we'll device a new sense the ability to not just capture the world in two-dimensional images but to actually understand it in three dimensions the structure sensor does just that it's the world's first 3d sensor for mobile devices what I really am excited about the destructor sensor is it makes it so easy you can clip it to a mobile device and walk around your world basically pull your world into a digital form my name is Jeff powers and I'm a founder of occipital we're passionate about giving devices the ability to see and understand the world around them this isn't about taking pictures it's about computer vision and interaction we call it spatial computing it's much bigger than just us and it's going to change the way we interact with the world let me show you what you can do with it you'll be able to capture every dimension of an entire room in a matter of seconds and you can send a model to your phone so you can get any dimension you need at any time you'll be able to easily capture and send three-dimensional objects across town or across the world and make decisions together even when you're apart you'll be able to play games games where the real world becomes the game world structureworks by capturing a pattern of invisible laser projected light which allows you to measure thousands of distances all at once the iPad has arguably the best user experience of any tablet and it was important to us to go the extra mile to make structure work specifically with it structure latches securely to your iPad it connects via the new lightning connector the end result is actually thermal design mechanical design industrial design open put together into one perfect object structures single piece body is machined from high-grade anodized aluminum it serves as both a beautiful exterior and as a thermal core that keeps the precision optics inside at an optimal temperature what's really important is get a platform out there and see what developers do it you'll get an SDK that lets you tap into a 3d sensor on iOS you'll have complete low-level access to the sensor and if you don't feel like processing raw depth data you can tap into the high level api's if you want to develop on another platform we're giving you everything you need a USB hacker cable open source drivers and even open CAD specs so you can 3d print your own attachment for almost anything new senses are going to make possible new applications for me the challenge has been in creating three-dimensional objects this completely obliterates that challenge structure is the sensor we always want it bad panel through 60 and red lays there so this is a team that can actually pull this off get a sensor and be one of the first to experience what happens when your mobile device can understand the world in three dimensions we need a new way to get around town we need something fun cool innovative and let's not forget green and great for the environment introducing the scoot Matic it's half bike
