hello guys today we are going to have an overview of emerging technologies in wireless network before going to emerging technologies you need to understand what is wireless network and how it has developed over the years the simple meaning of wireless is having new eyes in wireless network networking nodes are connected without wires data is generally transmitted using radio communication wsm SS l stands for wireless sensor network the glisten has a good function of data collection transmission and processing it has many advantages compared to wired network at present near field communication has been used widely especially Bluetooth wireless LAN infrared etc but they have number of disadvantages in order to satisfy demand of low power dissipation and low speed among the wireless communication devices a new type of wireless technology has emerged known as zigbee zippy is i triple e 8 not 2.15 14 standard it offers full wireless mesh networking capable of supporting more than 64,000 devices on a single Network it operated in 2.4 g d'arcy quincy bag it is multiple star topology and wireless personal area later zigni has various transmission options including your custom the rate of data transfer is 250kbps so zigboo is used in application where low data rate is required such as greenhouse monitoring parking vacancy monitoring system design of intelligent warehouse measured home automation and control why mix it is a wireless metropolitan area network it is short form of worldwide interoperability for microbial axis that is I to Polly 1802 points16 standard vimax operates similar to Wi-Fi but with higher speed and over great distance with the great number of fuses by Mac system consists of two parts biomech strong one and WiMAX deceiver is similar to cell phone tower providing very large area receiver can be built into any devices which can exist bye max bye max tower can connect directly to internet using high bandwidth wired connection my amex can provide two types of services non line-of-sight services and line-of-sight services non line-of-sight services uses frequency range to regard to 11g guards same as Wi-Fi where line-of-sight services uses 66 key guards frequency band chara chara file stands for gigabyte fidelity it is a wireless transmission system 10 times faster than the other technology and should delivers short-range moiety gigabit data transfer in local environment data transfer speed up to 5gbps within the range of 10 meters the joy fire operates on a 60 gig ards frequency band this frequency currently unused it is manufactured using CMOS technology the benefits and features of this new technology can be helpful for use in development of next-generation devices and places GFI technology can be used in home and offices of future wagging application like edge duty we require high rate of data transfer around 3gbps which cannot be provided by WLAN or myself hence in may 2009 a newly formed group for wireless gigabit alliance announced its intentions to create a new high speed wireless standard widely Waikiki will primarily be used within a single room to provide a wireless connectivity between home entertainment equipment it will enable very fast data transfer and losing streaming media in addition to wireless connection for cameras laptops and more so in this video we have seen technologies like zigbee vimax GFI vy-jee the world of wireless telecommunication is rapidly evolving and providing service to more number of users in less number of time the development of new technologies have graced our standard of living thank you you created using powtoon
