hi I'm Sarah Backhouse a future 360 we're here to explore emerging technologies here at New York energy week today's panel focuses on the commercialization of advanced energy technologies looking at past successes and at what lies ahead there's always transformation going on in the energy industry and so we're just looking for those new clean energy ideas and helping those companies deploy clean energy technologies you know when they're ready to do that first commercial deployment certainly one of the major drivers a lot of people think about is the new innovation that's going on in energy do devices energy storage solar new technologies around how we manage the grid a lot of that is in response to understanding about climate change and then needs to clean our energy system but energy is the underpinning of economic growth so we have to do this in really sound business ways ways that aren't just about deploying clean energy but making clean energy a driver for economic growth for the region's competitiveness we're there to really provide a very large entrenched industry and so we're trying to give them that early stage capital that allows them to prove out their technology and get it to a point where when they leave our be they're able to start competing down the cost curve and really take that new technology to the point where it can compete with you know three dollar gallon gasoline you ten cents a kilowatt hour electricity and actually get out there and make a difference New York energy week is an important convening mechanism to inspire collaboration very happy that there is a New York energy week a lot about where New York is sort of come as being this real important center for innovative activities in the commercial space and the public's eye for energy and I think anytime you have an event like this that's drawing people really together from very different ends at the very large energy universe putting them together in the same room to talk to each other that's going to bear interesting fruit events like New York energy week are really important to our program because a lot of people just don't even know that we exist several things but partly celebrating the progress we're making partly learning from each other looking at what are the next series of problems or opportunity we have to tackle investors and government agencies agree that advancing the investment and commercialization of energy technologies is key for the future of the energy sector Oh
