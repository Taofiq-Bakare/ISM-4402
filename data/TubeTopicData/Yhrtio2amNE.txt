thank you for watching the Red Hat storage channel I mera saath rahen at Red Hat summit 2015 in Boston and with me I have Steve wat from our emerging technologies organization ID right hat Steve welcome thanks glad to be here great how are you enjoying the conference it's been awesome there's rats had a lot of interesting things to announce this year I think one of the things I'll be most excited about is all the work we've been doing announcing around containers and open shift I think there's a lot of really exciting things happening there super so can you break down what containers are for audience very quickly yeah sure they're basically it you know docker is a sort of a packaging innovation that allows you to sort of encapsulate a process within a sort of a discrete modular you know unit which allows you to sort of be able to spin them up and tear them down very easily and I think people are seeing this packaging innovation is really useful for a new way of sort of building applications and you know further supporting continuous deployment continuous delivery and also just you know allowing people to sort of deploy applications more expediently super and you know your team is out there spearheading a lot of the research around emerging workloads you know with big data and storage can you walk us through some of that work yeah sure so one of the aspects that we contributed to is on around atomic storage and openshift storage so should probably just step back and explain the ecosystem right so essentially relat Amish uses docker and then Cuban 80s on top of that and so darker provides a sort of seminal container execution framework and then coo benetti's is a container orchestration framework for managing large clusters of containers and so essentially around the storage enablement which is where emerging technologies has been participating is what we've been doing is building in Cuba Nettie's volume plugins so these essentially we create volume plugins for specific types of storage assets so we have a generic one for NFS so this allows you to NFS mounts NFS provider directly into a container so we make it pretty simple and easy to do that but we've also built a whole host of other ones like I scuzzy so if you have a nice cozy disk that you want to mount into a container or SIF block devices save file systems cluster volumes and then obviously we test these inside the atomic operating system and so you have a level of comfort that these are all work with selinux enabled great and you know one of the key teams that we're seeing at the at the summer at summit is obviously wrong containers but we're also hearing a lot of buzz around OpenStack and open shift as well as open just the fact that it's not just about open source but an open community and storage is at the epicenter of all of those things so I think it's young it's an exciting time for right at George yeah I think it's really interesting in that you know part of the the layered model is that the one layer above kooban eighties is open shift right and so open shift provides a platform as a service and essentially what that really means to a company is that you know they can deploy open shift and open shift can leverage kubin eighties and docker to very quickly ingest new technologies into its platform and expose those to the development the developer so that the developer can simply build applications you know essentially work with the git repository push the change and the coup benetti's platform and open shift will deploy it you know and make that application available so it's amazing for developer productivity which sort of free some organizational intellectual capacity app to sort of tackle more business challenges so really exciting great Steve thanks so much a my pleasure you can learn more at our website and on our blog look for a redhat com / storage you you
