what we have here is the connected police officer the components of the system is the smart felt right which has a gun in it as well as a teaser some pepper spray those kind of things the different components in the smart belt for example the gun has a sensor in it so it can detect whether the gun has been pulled or not the smart glasses have a camera in them as well as a heads-up display so what the officer is wearing them he can be getting information from his equipment or from the the command staff without him needing to take his eyes away from the scene to look down a device or something the other big component would be what's it back at the dispatch center that the command staff is looking at and in you know typical display it's a map of you know where the officer is I'm going to be displaying his status of what's going on at the incident the last two items are a traditional mobile mobile radio so this is a land mobile radio and it's what the officers have traditionally traditionally used and the newer smartphones working over LTE systems Public Safety LTE systems typically the officer will be on seeing and a situation arises so for example he needs to pull his gun when he pulls his gun the sensor in the belt detects that the gun is pulled sends information back to the command staff through the radio system and also at the same time tells the glasses to take a picture of what the officer is looking at so what the officer would need to do currently is when he pulls his gun he would have to take his radio and call in and say oh I'm in such-and-such a location and I just pulled my gun also if they wanted to take a picture they would have to manually pull out his smartphone or something takes a picture send the picture back to the command staff so now the officer doesn't have to do all those you know individual manipulations he doesn't have to take his eyes away from the scene so that makes the officer safer first of all that he's not looking down messing with all of his equipment and it also brings intelligence back to other people where they get you know more real-time information as well as the image of what's going on his or surroundings his location those kind of things so it's an improvement both for the officer and for the understanding of the situation as a whole
