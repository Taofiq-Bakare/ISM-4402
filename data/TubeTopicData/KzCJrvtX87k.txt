so first and foremost I think this is a really exciting competition the breadth of innovation that you see and the exposure that you get from doing these sort of things I think a really key it allows you as well to to network with with the partner companies but also with other innovators and I think those sort of things are a really key to to understanding how best to use your idea and take it forward even if you're at University doing your PhD or doing your post-op if you have an idea you can incite see how you can take that summer at the concept to the to the real world so the engineering part of that as well that's very useful and this is dis competition strictly going to help with that also green together the small companies are they open bounce ideas off each other they made with self collaboration that's also going to be beneficial astrazeneca's fatigue it partner with the RSC one of the things that's increasingly apparent has been a tourniquet is that innovation and open innovation is a way of life and so we're constantly looking for ways that we can tap into science it's being done outside we know we have good scientists that do great science in our labs but you need to get a different perspective on things and so looking for ways that we can work more freely with innovators to come up with innovative new medicines is something we're really keen on and this sort of competition really does speak to that sort of shared strategic goal that we have so one of the things that large established businesses can bring to a start-up is access to resources and access to expertise and a degree of credibility within the academic community and within other small medium-sized enterprises you get a big different aspect on things and working out how we can work together to leverage the innovation that comes out of these companies with the experience and know-how that we have within large pharmaceutical companies can really help accelerate those ideas towards in a particular medicine and really make a difference to patients and I think what attracted does the most was actually the opportunity to be mentored by someone that was really relevant in an industry that we were trying to attract with our product and one being glaxosmithkline was one of the potential mentors are in there and if we won the competition it was an opportunity to work with them and also in terms of market opportunity that wasn't that clear at that point because the company had only been going for six months so to be sat down with GSK with about 20 different science groups was so valuable and as a result we know actually do have a working relationship with GSK well we I mean we've worked work done some work for older since we throw our mentors from from the competition last year in the opportunity to party present so they to the technical teams and I guess it was an opportunity just to give a roux broad overview of the types of things that we were interested in the types of chemistry that we could do or we do do if we can find some overlap including our products in any of their formulations or as a as a link to their own their products then obviously again quarter much bigger companies and we are at some hand-holding can it can help well winning the competition we hope it will bring us some extra exposure that all people read that we exist in that we have a nice solution to save energy and that they can improve their sustainability by using our technology we hope that we have this exposure this year particularly they've obviously knows on the second day where you cannot do this is it boost camp and that's really valuable I think actually when the award and the next week comment and your serve intensive day of really getting to think about your business rather than just the science and then I think that will be highly valuable for the future of the competition and those who win it so as I aside from the money it's a nice certification that among salafi are the great competitors and ideas that were out there that your one has been noticed a bit more and so that's obviously goods they need the industry contact and the exposure and all add 2 to the obvious financial gain I think it's been a really good way for people to make contacts and to learn from other people and to find people that might help them take things to the next level you
