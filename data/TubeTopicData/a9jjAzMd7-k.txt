[Music] alright awesome I'm Ariel Zuckerberg of a partner kleiner and today I'm going to talk about overcoming at human limitations through emerging technologies here's a little bit about me they gave you the intro so I'll skip this one we're in a post evolution era natural selection has run its course if you don't believe me ask your vegan friends I believe that we are moving towards a transhumanist future and we always have been a future in which science and technology will continue to develop and use science and technology to increase human capacity in the mental physical and reproductive realms so today I'm going to talk about three emerging technologies that I believe will increase human capacity and overcome limitations and I'm got also going to talk about the ethical conflicts I believe will arise from that but first let's talk about where we are now nowit robux or people have various ways of pronouncing this but today I'm going to go with no aerobics or smart drugs uh including the daphon all I which is a wakefulness promoting agent which increases alertness facilitates reasoning is the only modasa knows the only drug that's approved by the US Air Force for helicopter pilots and extended missions it's also clinically prescribed for narcolepsy but increasingly everyday people are using madhavi nil and saying that they're reaping extreme benefits from using this smart drug here's a quote from the founder and CEO bulletproof I used smart trucks and have for years I use MIDI fennel I got my warden MBA while working full-time at a startup that sold for six hundred million dollars users claimed that madoff anil helps with writer's block cramming for exams cleaning your apartment from floor to ceiling alpha dies in your bookcase so another thing that improves increases cognitive efficiency is of course mobile phones and the internet there's no excuse not to know anything anymore this allows us to look up anything anywhere at any time in addition to extending and expanding our knowledge mobile phones also serve as an external memory storage for things like our thoughts ideas the people we know our friends birthdays so let's talk about physical enhancement when t16 you have surgery orthodontics corrective lenses medical devices in general that can improve both cause cosmetic and corrective procedures one example is vision correction which is very near and dear to me i'm basically legally blind without my contacts or glasses i but in addition to Corrections some people are taking this a step further some people are going above and beyond to get beyond perfect vision for example mark mcgwire who also use performance-enhancing drugs to score 70 home runs which is record in 1988 also had custom design contact lenses to improve his vision which could definitely make a difference when fastball is coming at you at 95 miles an hour tiger woods and other golfers I think dozens of golfers now do this but I think he kind of was the first one to leave the charge lost 16 straight tournaments before getting laser eye surgery but after upgrading his vision he won seven of the next 10 tournaments so the people are already you know doing these procedures not just for corrective purposes but to enhance beyond perfect and I think we'll just see more and more of that and you know the question of whether or not this is cheating I feel will definitely come up in the future and in what context it's cheating what how far beyond perfect can one go we also have artificial limbs and organs of course for people who've gone through injuries or diseases chair feels is a US Army sergeant won a gold medal for the 100 meters in a 12-point 15 second time Usain Bolt obviously ran it in 9.58 seconds but there are questions here as the technology gets better and better you know we might break the human limit if you have prosthetic limbs the natural human limit of course so reproductive enhancement so increasingly women are having children in their 30s and 40s and a lot of people are questioning whether it is their obligation to go through the invasive prenatal testing call amniocentesis uh where a needle is injected into the uterus I'll go into that a little later but I they're both invasive and non-invasive methods and prenatal diagnosis has made it possible for people to have a better understanding of you know the condition of their fetus before it's born [Music] contraception also here's where we are today obviously there's some work to be done on the male side but there has been progress I study was conducted recently to test a male contraception and here's what happened an external peer review committee determined that for safety reasons recruitment should be stopped the adverse side effects included mood changes depression pain the injection site and increased libido women have been dealing with these side effects for a long time bomb this study was stopped because of those side effects hopefully in the future will will overcome that and i think this also brings to light some ethical issues and gender issues so let's talk about emerging technologies that was where we are today here's where i believe where we're going AI assistance with an AR overlay an augmented reality overlay which is a natural extension i believe of mobile phones plus plus the internet so this is an example have anyone has anyone seen black mirror if you watch black mirror yeah and so this is from the episode where everyone has these contact lenses or ocular implants exactly clear what it is but it allows them to see people's ratings and other information just by looking at someone this is kind of a dark example but you'd also see it in a more practical context like you're cooking or you know you're looking at a rambutan which is what that crazy fruit was before and you can ask your AI assistant what is this or who is that how do I know this person and maybe it's a cochlear implant or just some kind of cue to show you exactly what you want to know when you want to know and you won't have to look it up anymore I think you'll just ask and the answer will come hopefully like a Jarvis style sidekick we talked about prosthetics before but pricey seas are becoming more and more complex and now you can control them with your mind and I don't know if I necessarily have a clear opinion on this but I think I can imagine a future where people choose to get these robotic limbs to replace their natural ones even if they haven't had their limb amputated or you know maybe people will just want better functionality and I think that's definitely possible uh maybe people will replace their their feet with something that you know if you're an ice climber you want to replace your feet with something it's better for the things you want to do when you want to do them maybe they'll even be detachable you know you can have set of attachment genetic engineering this is the next step in reproductive enhancements and this is a clip from Gattaca in which people this is a pretty old movie but it kind of I well illustrates issues that I think we'll be dealing with in the future where people will be expected if they have the means and the ability to select the best possible you know option from from embryo from possible embryos I you know you could pick physical features metabolic features you know understand whether or not your child your potential child is going to carry diseases and a question arises I mean do people have an obligation to to engineer the perfect child or does what are the child's rights for the parents rights and I think as this technology becomes increasingly available you know will people have the duties who to genetically enhance and modify their offspring so I mentioned a couple of the ethical complex as I was going along but I think the main one is that and this is so true today which is you know a lot of high medicine is only available to people of a certain wealth and the wealth concentration is is increasing over time and I feel like this will only further by 4k humans into into two groups enhanced humans are people who have access to a lot of these improvements and you know natural humans are people who don't have access to the improvements who don't have the ability to you know get an ocular implants they can have an it AR overlay or people who don't have the ability to you know get corrective for corrective procedures um I think yeah people who can afford these enhancements will hugely benefit and people who can't afford them will will be left behind so this is I think a huge issue that you know we'll definitely have to think about an address going forward also it doesn't help that a lot of scientific research most scientific research is privately funded versus state funded and a lot of those private funding sources have commercial interests potentially so I don't think this is something that can be stopped and nor would I advocate for this to be something that should be stopped but I do think I reproductive like what is our duty to you know design the perfect child or select the perfect child from several options what is the definition of cheating you know it will we allow athletes to have better than perfect but we're currently allowing athletes have better than perfect vision but you know where does little to where do we draw the line and in what context is it okay to yell these corrective procedures or enhancing procedures and also furthering the wealth divide the concentration of not just wealth but also access intelligence and all these enhancements cool thank you [Applause]
