well hello everybody welcome back have you ever heard about gardeners hype cycle for emerging technologies well if you haven't you're in for a treat we'll take a look at it are you curious about where the big data stand we talk a lot about the hype we talk a lot about the motivation why do we have these challenges where's data coming from but let's look at how it compares to other technologies so Gardner has released a gardener actually every year releases a different hype cycle for the emerging technologies and this one came in 2014 there is not one for 2015 yet though update as soon as it comes out and he wanted to be wanted to see how does the big data move through this cycle of innovation when he was triggered when he started and things were really excited then they typically reach this with a pecan avoided expectations and then you go down through this you know this is the woodsman and there's a little slope of enlightenment and then you kind of reach that plateau and maybe the technology's even become obsolete so where does the big data right here as you can see in this hype cycle the data sent is data science is projected to reach the plateau in about two to five years and it looks like it's more of a discipline than a technology however it seems like the big data is still considered to be five to ten years away from reaching its stage of the disillusionment and while the interest in the big data still seems to be undiminished it has moved through the peak because of the market and so many companies they have settled to kind of reasonable approaches to technologies there is not while increasing completely new and innovative technologies coming out and so it seems like the market is kind of settling a little bit so one of the interesting things to point out here is is what is at the very top of this big Internet of Things so what is internet of things well let's find out I'm sure everybody has heard of Internet of Things it is connecting things on the internet putting them all in a cloud and having them talk to each other and then talking back to them right that's the definition well sort of that's a pretty good indication of your understanding of Internet of Things so you can see that we have spent many many years trying to index the world collected data about the world bring that world online the internet came then we were trying to kind of take control over things that we had and be able to organize and integrate them then we wanted things to start talking to each other computers to start talking to each other now we have sensors starting talking to each other things on the internet starting to talk to each other and then now we want those things to not only talk to each other but actually be intelligent about the conversation and the actions they can take right so this is what brings this this new approach to Big Data to the Internet of Things and we'll can start exploring to learn a little bit more how is there any kind of overlap is there one day motivate each other do they drive each other's technologies our date may be challenging each other's technologies so the idea behind the internet of thing is that you have a lot of networks full of sensors you want to connect and enable those sensors and networks to talk to each other be able to report on their status collect that data into several or one large data store be able to do some analytics and perform analytics on that data and then have that feedback control and send that back so the idea of the Internet of Things is not only to improve our everyday lives although there's a lot of new technologies and companies and businesses being started based on that idea but it really is to help overall industry and one of the applications that scanning all the popularity is instrumenting industrial machines extracting information about that system or the machine or the storage that's involved with that machine being able to take that data send it to the big data analytics be able to then remotely or in a centralized manner do something with that information share that data send it back and be able to work in this iterative loop through a secure hopefully cloud-based network where you can take this physical and human networks and be able to incorporate all of this data together in an intelligent way so today's scientists are talking about yottabytes so we have talked about gigabytes terabytes petabytes exabytes now we're talking about the other bytes and then we're talking about branta bytes as well and that is a lot of information and the large amount of that information is produced and driven by the idea of Internet of Things by the technologies and sensors employ in those architectures so if you're interested in comparing the sizes of Q 0 bytes megabytes and gigabytes here is your pyramid the point we're trying to make is that the Internet of Things is going to grow more data more variety of data data coming faster to us so the variety complexity and volume are just going to increase with the Internet of Things and it's going to make Big Data technologies even more important and more applicable to the kind of solutions we were going to deploy
