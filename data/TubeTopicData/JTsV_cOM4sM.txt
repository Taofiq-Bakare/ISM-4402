of people registered today and and you'll hear more about that as we go along to start I've got some thank yous so the first thing I want to do is thank our sponsors as you can see there are a lot of people that are committed to your education what makes them really special is not only are they willing to contribute the funds to pay for this forum that we're in but they they also provide educational contents the majority of these companies provided subject matter experts to work with government counterparts and workgroups over the last six months to develop the educational content that you're going to be experiencing today the people that I just talked to you about all of those all those private sector entities have partnered with government counterparts and those people make up our advisory board and as you can tell there are a lot of people that are involved in developing educational content for you so can we get a round of applause for all of the hard work these people put in today's agenda obviously we've got opening remarks from your executive sponsor he's got a special guest that he's going to bring up to tell you about the state's innovation center which is way cool we're going to show you the new PSP mobile application so that you can get up-to-date information any room changes special notes access to the documents and presentations that are used within the education sessions and reference documentation that you'll need in addition to that you'll be able to evaluate the education session right there on the spot and we use that information to make these events better each and every iteration after that we're going to present some short education presentations we use the acronym sep because ted was already taken these presentations are going to be 10 to 12 minutes in length and they're going to demonstrate a lot of entities out there within the government environment that are using emerging technologies to improve the way that they serve the citizenry in California when we finish with that it will be time for your education sessions there's going to be two morning education sessions then you'll get to come back in here for lunch after the lunch after you get your lunch you'll have three more short education presentations then we'll break again for two more education sessions this afternoon and then finally we'll come back together oops I'm sorry after the set we're going to have an opportunity you're going to have an opportunity to hear from the broadband panel this is a group of top-level government people that are involved in getting broadband out to the so that everybody in California is going to be connected this is a tremendous effort and it's an opportunity for you to get an update on the initiative and listen to how you within your own individual organizations could help that process then we will break for the afternoon education sessions and then when we come back it'll be time for the award ceremony so all of those government solutions that you see out in the solution center next door we're there is going to be a team of judges that are going to go around and evaluate those and we will be awarding the most innovative most valuable coolest solutions in that group after that it's time to eat drink and be merry you'll need it after a full day of education there's going to be food and drink galore out in this main room to say thank you for staying here the whole day and I would encourage you to do that a lot of people put a lot of time into these sessions and it's it's a little disheartening if you're the last presenter of the day to have a half-full classroom so we would encourage you please to stick around for the full agenda if you have time during the day we'd also encourage you to review the government showcase solutions that are out there to see how your peers are leveraging technology and what you could do to leverage it in addition to that all of the sponsors are located around the government showcase please stop by and thank them for making this available to you let's get the show started three years ago Carlos Ramos came to me with an idea to provide an annual educational forum for the IT personnel and their program partners this effort allows you to attend a full day of educate tional content and in these times of tight budgets and and a real challenge of getting educational forays approved this this is an attempt to begin to meet that need and expose you to ongoing and updated education this year the baton was passed to Chris Cruz who picked up picked it up with a passion and carried it forward for those of you that may not have had a chance to get to know Chris yet officially he's the chief deputy director of operations at the California Department of Technology Chris oversees the delivery of California data center services to over 400 state local government entities he's responsible for the state's consolidated email systems approximately a

remind us that we're in an even year so without any further ado please welcome to the stage Chris Cruz well good morning everybody as Ross said it's an even year but I don't know the way the Giants are playing I'm not too sure about that I think I'll bring my son and to be a relief pitcher on that team anyway good morning everybody and thank you for being here it's a pleasure serving as executive sponsor for this event as you know emerging and adaptive technologies is a big part of our business today here in California and we're going to give you some tangible examples of how we're effectuating those types of skills and changes here and some of the things that we're doing to promote innovation and drive transformational activities and civic engagements on behalf of the Department of Technology I'm pleased to welcome you again to the 3rd annual emerging technologies conference continuing from the last forum we're going to talk about strategic and tactical ideas we're going to talk about promoting collaboration and education amongst our public private partnerships and really look at the core competency themes moving forward in government as you know what challenge comes great opportunity to be more efficient and effective in how we deliver services and this conference will give you some ideas and best practices and in terms of how we're going to move forward to address those applicable changes as executive sponsor the event I would like to really thank Russ Hicks and Cheryl and Hammond from public sector partners but really taking on I think these opportunities and key areas that are important to every one of us as government employees and also within the private sector I mean there's lots of best practices and lessons learned that we can glean from these particular events and it's very important so roster Lynn thank you again for taking these opportunities on and allowing us in government to address these challenges and come together for a day so again thank you very much I also wanted to thank the Executive Council and advisory board of vendors of state city county and municipalities were coming together to put the right theme and what I figure like a level of curriculum together that's really going to drive and promote change here in California I think this is really important also to I wanted to thank the educational institutions you'll see out in our area advisory board area and out on the forum area and board that we have high schools here represented so we have several high schools here today within Maker Faires that they're innovating and driving transformational technologies and these are this is our future and so how do we bring those young folks into government how do we have succession and workforce planning to drive those applicable efficiency create effectiveness in government so we're going to talk a little bit about that today and discuss how we do that that's our future output on this wall and it's very important that they have a path into government to carry on the legacy that will all leave as we move forward some of the key and adaptive and emerging technologies that we will hear from today is security and risk management obviously cloud services open source and open data which has become a big big area in California government that we're starting to address here at the state and moving forward with our collaborative partners consolidation and optimization business intelligence and data analytics enterprise visions and roadmaps for IT budget and cost control how do we adapt our budgets today to align with tomorrow human resource and talent management again speaking to succession and Workforce Planning how are we going to dress that moving forward which is really important as we on board Millennials and younger people into our workforce agile and incremental software delivery how are we changing the way the state does system development delivery of large system integration projects is it agile is it a hybrid of agile is it waterfall and what are the processes of methods that we can see from tangible business cases moving forward and how those business cases have been successful you know it's time for California government to focus on really improving the services that it offers and how it interacts with the citizens that we need you know we live in a time as sit at civic engagement and citizen transparency and it's very important that our citizens get access to data whether that's demographic data whether that's health care data whether that's all types of information of data on demand and it's very important that we bring those deliberations into their smartphones we've did a survey a couple of years ago and found that almost a third of Californians have smartphones today we think it's 14 to 15 million of the 37 million people to live in the state so it's very important that they're checking their smartphones and have that service of accessible delivery but most important for that is how do we secure that to make sure data is encrypted at transit and also cricket addressed this has become a big issue in California that we're also taking on is providing data through a transparent mechanism but ensuring that is reliable and secure moving forward so one of the things I also wanted to discuss today at the conference and component of the California part technology strategic plan this will leverage public-private partnership some driving innovative and IT solutions it's very important that we take that into consideration as we move forward and today's conference and the theme that we've laid about really addresses those outcomes in terms of performance-based you know they say if you let data drive decisions you'll be more effective and efficient and how you lead and run government and so some of the things that you'll see today with some of the breakout sessions will lead to those types of best practices and lessons learned if you in the last few years California State Department's and governments are requiring faster and more effective IT solutions so today again you'll hear about cloud transformation and what are we doing with cloud most notably the hybrid cloud and how we're going to bring efficient and more cost reliable effective services to a reliable infrastructure in California that centralizes from a security perspective and we think that that's increasingly important as we move forward here and drive those particular innovations really the state's vision is to be a catalyst of new technology and deliver methods to make more cost-effective and flexible and innovative technology and I think you're going to see examples of that in some of the presentations that we have as well you know we're working for you but this is a collaborative partnership you know they say it takes a village to raise a child well it takes a village to run a dedicated IT organization in the state of the seventh eighth largest economy in the world and that's why we're all here today is working together and partnering to make sure that why we're in the boat that we're moving in the same direction cuddling together one of the other components of this new and emerging and adaptive technologies in addition to cloud is our new CEO of website how many have visited the new California CA gov website you like it well those are the kinds of things that we're talking about in terms of innovation and driving transformational competencies and capabilities so you're going to see more of that from the state of California and our partnerships working with the cities and counties educational institutions and of course our vendor community to make these things possible one of the other areas again that we're driving and Russ made a note of this is our new office of digital innovation and Technology engagement this was a brainchild of us coming into this organization thinking about how can we innovate and transform government and make it more efficient and effective as my duties as the state's chief technology officer is part of my operational duties we know we looked at how can we innovate and transform California so we look at the ca.gov site is really the conduit for citizen engagement for a government transparency and really looking at a one-stop portal moving forward government before I introduce Scott Gregor to speak about these new and exciting developments I really wanted to thank you for attending and sharing a common interests to promote smarter and more efficient and innovative government in California it's up to us to really carry the baton and move it forward not kick the can down the road but tangible action today to ensure that we're executing and carrying out technology that aligns with strategic partnerships and also bringing value to our business partners without that we won't have successful technology in the state again it's a real privilege to serve as executive sponsor for today's event I really want to thank you for coming I hope that you enjoy the day and hope please make this an exciting an innovative day I hope you learn a lot and there's a lot of takeaways that come through this and please feel free to stop in and say hello so again on behalf of the third annual emerging technologies conference thank you for coming and I hope that you have a great day and again I want to move this and transition this over to Scott Gregory he's the special guest he's the new deputy director / office of digital digital innovation and technology engagement
