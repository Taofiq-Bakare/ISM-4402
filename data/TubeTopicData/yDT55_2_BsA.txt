the siggraph emerging technologies program presents innovative technologies in several fields from displays and input devices to collaborative environments and technologies that will transform the way we live and work this video shows just a few clips from the amazing work shown at the 2015 emerging technologies venue Ford immersive vehicle environment is a highly realistic immersive virtual reality system that addresses the unique challenges of automotive design engineering and ergonomics this project allows users to interact with life-size 3d digital humans displayed on an auto multi scopic projector array fairy lights is interactive aerial in volumetric graphics rendered by a focused femtosecond laser with computational holographic fields this project augments user gestures in gameplay with dynamic haptic feedback on and across hands this multi projector display system can easily reconfigure content of arbitrary shape size and resolution by changing the number and configuration of projectors childhood virtually realizes a child's eye and hand movements via a viewport translator and a hand exoskeleton this project allows for the rolling shutter effect to be observed by the naked eye in real-time using spatially divided stroboscopic projection the midair touch display allows us to see and virtually touch floating objects with our bare hands by creating an overlapped array of projected images projection technology can be used to create truly seamless displays with resolution that can scale up to ten to millions of pixels come see these projects and more at the 2015 emerging technologies venue you
