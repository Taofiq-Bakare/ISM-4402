All right, welcome to today‹¨«s Council on Foreign Relations meeting. My name is Lee Brenner. I‹¨«m a business development lead on the Technology and Civic Engagement Team over at Microsoft. I‹¨«m a term member of the Council as well‹¨«but really excited to be here to talk about emerging technology, ‹¨«The Future of Space.‹¨« We have three great panelists: Lori Garver, who is the general manger of the Air Line Pilots Association. She‹¨«s also the former deputy administrator of NASA; John Logsdon, a professor emeritus of political science and international affairs from the‹¨«at the Elliott School of International Affairs, and a longtime space policy person in Washington, D.C. and is part of the United States space policy; and Charles Miller, president of NexGen Space, LLC. So I think we‹¨«re going to start‹¨«Charles is actually going to give an overview of what we‹¨«re really going to talk about to give a base for our conversation. Then I‹¨«m going to ask each of the panelists to give a little bit of an overview. Then we‹¨«re going to jump into questions‹¨«a really, hopefully, in-depth discussion. And then we‹¨«ll open up the questions to you. So hopefully you will have many of those questions as well. Thanks, Lee. So I‹¨«ve got a few minutes. They asked me to set the context of the conversation for ‹¨«The Future of Space.‹¨« There is a few general arcs that overlie most key issues in space today, and some current situational issues. One of the first arcs is really called the arc of Apollo. Apollo was this amazing success and we‹¨«ve been trying to repeat Apollo since then and had many attempts to do so since Apollo‹¨«nearly approaching 50 years now. There has been many attempts to repeat it. First was Bush 41 on the 20th anniversary and it didn‹¨«t work. It was unaffordable. Again‹¨«actually, the first one‹¨«that was the second one. The first one was following Apollo. Dr. Logsdon wrote a book on it. After Apollo, in the Nixon administration they tried to get in an attempt to go to Mars. It was considered to be unaffordable. Then the second one with Bush 41, considered to be unaffordable. And the third attempt was the Vision for Space Exploration in Bush 43‹¨«s administration. And they wanted it to be affordable. They set the guidance to do it within the existing budget, but NASA stood up a plan called Constellation that was ultimately unaffordable. Lori here, as deputy administration of NASA, was part of the leadership and this independent review that looked at it again, three in a row. It was unaffordable so they cancelled Constellation and set up some of the situation where we are today. They tried to do a new innovation with commercial and technology to achieve our national goals in space at a much lower price. That was resisted. So one of the key themes today is the dynamics between the old traditional approach to space with traditional government-centric model. And you call that kind of maybe the status quo. Some say ‹¨«old space.‹¨« And then there‹¨«s another dynamic, innovative, commercial approach‹¨«some call it ‹¨«new space‹¨«‹¨«that wants to propose new space. Some of the fundamentals going on is the International Space Station was justified as a national geopolitical‹¨«it was saved. It was on the verge of being cancelled and we brought Russia in. So national geopolitical objectives play a very important role in space, which is why‹¨«part of the reason we‹¨«re having this event here. And it saved the space station. It just satisfied its‹¨«had its 15th-year anniversary of Humans in Space at the International Space Station. I think 15 nations are there. It also was a key part of Apollo. It was the geopolitical justification. It was the real reason‹¨«and one of Dr. Logsdon‹¨«s books goes into great detail that Kennedy created the Apollo program. It was a masterful exercise of soft power. Some of the other thrusts going on is we‹¨«re still today‹¨«we have about $3 billion a year; NASA‹¨«s focus on a Mars program. They were recently criticized on this Mars program. They still don‹¨«t have a program and strategy. They don‹¨«t have a budget or schedule to show when they‹¨«re getting to Mars or how much it‹¨«s going to cost. And meanwhile, commercial space keeps on going along. You have companies like SpaceX with Elon Musk. You have, I mean, Paul Allen investing in it. And you have Jeff Bezos from Amazon.com with a company called Blue Origin, and a lot of other companies, including some of your members of the Council of Foreign Relations, like Laetitia Garriott is the president of a company called Escape Dynamics. There‹¨«s a lot of innovation in that area. And that kind of sets the stage for where we are today. What I‹¨«m doing in this‹¨«just a short one 17:02:18,485 --> 17:02:24,618 minute‹¨«I recently‹¨«NextGen Space completed a study for NASA, funded by NASA, of if‹¨«could 16:36:31,416 --> 16:36:37,416 we leverage commercial space partnerships to send humans to deep space? And we specifically 16:28:37,735 --> 16:28:44,135 looked at the Moon. And the answer was‹¨«and we had a bunch of former retired NASA engineers‹¨«is 16:28:39,025 --> 16:28:45,225 we could return humans to the Moon using commercial partnerships by the end of the second term 16:28:44,147 --> 16:28:50,147 of the next president, and do it within NASA‹¨«s existing budget, and looked at things like 16:30:16,216 --> 16:30:22,282 an international lunar authority. And there‹¨«s, you know, significant geopolitical benefits 16:30:16,536 --> 16:30:20,602 to that as well, but that‹¨«s what NexGen Space is working on. 16:30:16,556 --> 16:30:22,356 Right. Thank you, Charles, very much. Lori, give us a little bit of background. 16:30:16,777 --> 16:30:22,510 Obviously we know you‹¨«ve worked at NASA. And I‹¨«ll set‹¨«I‹¨«ll set this up for your 16:30:16,846 --> 16:30:22,912 kind of introductory, but is NASA doing what it needs to do to support emerging technologies 16:30:16,926 --> 16:30:22,259 in the space‹¨«in the space space? So, my background in political science 16:32:23,796 --> 16:32:29,529 and economics led me to really focus on far space policy, the purpose and the ‹¨«why‹¨« 16:32:24,185 --> 16:32:29,918 we are exploring it. Of course, as Charles said, we are focused here today on the human 16:32:25,647 --> 16:32:31,780 spaceflight part of NASA, and NASA, of course, is just the government part of space activity. 16:32:26,855 --> 16:32:32,388 So there‹¨«s a number of other things that are driven, I think, more by the purposes 16:32:32,137 --> 16:32:38,137 that drive large expenditures in other areas. And Neil Tyson gives a great talk about fear, 16:32:34,406 --> 16:32:40,939 greed, and glory. And to me, being very supportive of democracy and capitalism, we have the ability 16:32:35,887 --> 16:32:41,220 with space, I think, to reinforce both. And I did try to focus NASA more on doing 16:32:35,906 --> 16:32:41,639 that. Investment and technology is a big part of that because we know our government is 16:32:37,786 --> 16:32:43,586 here really as somewhat of a safety net and to buy down the risk, technical risk as well 16:32:39,426 --> 16:32:45,092 as market risk. And I believe a sustainable, long-term space exploration strategy does 16:32:41,736 --> 16:32:47,802 that by lowering the costs to entry, the barriers to entry, and utilizing all the talents of 16:32:45,435 --> 16:32:51,368 the nation for our benefits, whether those be economic, the greed part; fear, the national 16:36:27,456 --> 16:36:33,122 security part; or the glory part, which are a lot of the social benefits that come out 16:36:31,576 --> 16:36:35,642 of that investment. So I think we could do better, but NASA is 16:36:32,997 --> 16:36:38,730 an $18 billion agency doing a lot of amazing things for the nation and the world. And I 16:36:34,997 --> 16:36:38,997 think there, frankly, is a lot of political support for that. 16:36:36,616 --> 16:36:42,816 And, John, you‹¨«ve been paying attention to this since, really, the beginning of the 16:36:36,637 --> 16:36:42,503 space program, and been involved. Based on your observations over that time, is the space 16:36:38,486 --> 16:36:44,152 program where it is today‹¨«whether it‹¨«s the government space program or the broader 16:36:39,355 --> 16:36:45,021 space program‹¨«set up to be successful for whatever its goals are, or does there need 16:36:41,466 --> 16:36:45,599 to be a dramatic shift in the way people are thinking about it? 16:37:34,046 --> 16:37:39,846 Dramatic, no, but I think‹¨«as you say, I‹¨«ve been looking at this for 50-plus 16:38:07,786 --> 16:38:13,652 years‹¨«we‹¨«re closer to being able to send people to Mars today than we ever have been. 16:38:09,826 --> 16:38:16,092 It doesn‹¨«t mean we‹¨«re close, but the trajectory is in that direction, and so return to deep 16:39:56,666 --> 16:40:02,132 space. I think we should stop at the Moon on the way out‹¨«it‹¨«s just the offshore 16:40:14,616 --> 16:40:18,749 island‹¨«but we‹¨«re building systems that could take us there. 16:40:14,616 --> 16:40:20,282 The only problem, as Lori suggested, is that the attempt to inject new technology into 16:40:14,627 --> 16:40:20,427 those systems hasn‹¨«t worked. So we‹¨«re building systems based on ‹¨«70s technologies. 16:40:14,627 --> 16:40:20,560 Space shuttle main engine in particular is going to power the big new rocket, solid rocket 16:40:14,637 --> 16:40:20,237 boosters like were used on the shuttle. And we still haven‹¨«t adjusted our ambitions 16:40:14,637 --> 16:40:20,570 to the amount of resources the political system and the public seem willing to give to the 16:40:14,645 --> 16:40:20,645 space program, about a half of 1 percent of the federal budget. So the expectations created 16:40:15,007 --> 16:40:20,673 by early success really cast a shadow over what we are doing, which is not bad at all. 16:40:15,275 --> 16:40:21,141 On that point‹¨«and you talked about the idea of being‹¨«that there is these two 16:40:15,507 --> 16:40:21,173 space programs. There‹¨«s the commercial and government, but the commercial side, what 16:40:15,736 --> 16:40:21,802 you‹¨«re working on as well, is that that‹¨«s where the innovation is, right? That‹¨«s where 16:40:15,736 --> 16:40:21,336 people are putting‹¨«they‹¨«re building new technologies. What is stopping‹¨«and this 16:40:15,736 --> 16:40:22,069 is really for the entire panel‹¨«what is stopping the government from saying, all right, let‹¨«s 16:40:15,736 --> 16:40:21,602 take the rocket that was just built last year, opposed to the technology from the ‹¨«70s, 16:40:15,736 --> 16:40:20,269 and use that instead? What rocket built last year? (Laughs.) 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:10,623 Well, for‹¨«as an example, if there were a rocket. 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:10,423 Commercial rocket. A commercial rocket. 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:10,157 Well, there are. There are. You could use‹¨« 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:10,823 SpaceX is‹¨« SpaceX from the private, right. 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:09,223 You could use‹¨« (Cross talk.) 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:11,890 ‹¨«for a modern system. I mean, it‹¨«s the tale of government 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:12,357 overall. It is a bureaucracy. And NASA came out of the direction, as Charles said, of 16:42:06,757 --> 16:42:12,423 beating the Russians with Apollo, and sort of looking for a purpose ever since. And it 16:42:09,016 --> 16:42:14,882 becomes self-sustaining‹¨«self-sustainment as purpose. And so you have lots of people‹¨«I 16:43:49,326 --> 16:43:55,259 grew up with Apollo. I want to build the biggest rocket. So my question would be, who said 16:44:11,136 --> 16:44:17,002 the public had to pay for you to do that when there are other ways to do it that would be 16:44:11,926 --> 16:44:15,726 more efficient? We have, because it is public‹¨«s money, a 16:44:12,036 --> 16:44:18,036 way to get this funded through Congress. They have jobs in their district and it has become 16:44:12,757 --> 16:44:19,090 largely a jobs program. We built an infrastructure in Apollo that we‹¨«re trying to keep because 16:45:04,525 --> 16:45:10,258 that is in particular districts. So it is one of the reasons I was focused on expanding 16:50:08,277 --> 16:50:14,010 that commercial effort is because then you are motivated in ways that allow you to make 16:50:08,355 --> 16:50:13,155 more advancements because you‹¨«re not held back by the political system. 16:50:08,416 --> 16:50:14,349 And lately, you ask, what‹¨«s holding us back? One thing that‹¨«s holding us back 16:50:08,536 --> 16:50:13,936 is the U.S. Congress, kind of full stop. That‹¨«s surprising. (Laughter.) 16:50:08,536 --> 16:50:14,336 NASA too, though. Internal NASA pretty much convinced Congress that we should be 16:50:08,976 --> 16:50:12,309 doing‹¨« Right. Well, but the attempt that 16:50:09,546 --> 16:50:15,479 Lori and her associates made in 2010 to follow a new strategy was strongly resisted by the 16:50:10,235 --> 16:50:14,901 Hill and pushed back‹¨« And supported by parts of the agency‹¨« 16:50:10,235 --> 16:50:15,501 And supported by parts of the agency. ‹¨«and the big companies. 16:50:10,457 --> 16:50:15,523 Right. So there is a space industrial congressional, bureaucratic‹¨« 16:50:10,506 --> 16:50:14,039 Yes. ‹¨«I mean, classic triangle that 16:50:10,546 --> 16:50:16,479 still has a lot of power over the civil program, where, as you say, off on the side people 16:50:10,636 --> 16:50:13,836 saying, hey, there‹¨«s money to be made in space. 16:50:10,685 --> 16:50:14,818 Right. And that money can be made by injecting 16:50:10,735 --> 16:50:16,601 innovative technology in navigation and Earth observation and communication. They‹¨«re on 16:50:10,786 --> 16:50:15,719 an almost separate trajectory. The world we live in, you‹¨«re being watched 16:50:10,846 --> 16:50:12,712 24/7, tracked. Right. 16:50:10,866 --> 16:50:16,932 It‹¨«s all on your smartphone. There‹¨«s a GPS receiver in your smartphone. I mean, 16:50:10,946 --> 16:50:15,346 space is only a place to do a variety of things, to start out with. 16:50:11,156 --> 16:50:17,289 Well, and it‹¨«s so ironic because, of course, Eisenhower warned us of the industrial 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:16,826 triangle and that we have been held back by it. In addition, NASA was the very symbol 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:17,026 of capitalist ideals, as we went to the Moon and beat the Russians, and now what we‹¨«re 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:16,826 working with is more of a socialist part of plan for space exploration, which is just 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:17,292 anathema to what this country should be doing. So, building off what Lori just said, 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:17,226 we have a clear, stark choice that most people don‹¨«t understand, but it‹¨«s really stark. 16:50:11,226 --> 16:50:17,026 You can either control where the jobs are, OK, and make sure they‹¨«re in your district, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 which many politicians who are in control of the purse strings of NASA, you know, do, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 or you can let go of control. There‹¨«s going to be the same amount of jobs but there‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 going to be a lot more dynamic innovation and we‹¨«re going to achieve our goals in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,779 space, our national goals of putting humans into the Solar System. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 And the first one, we‹¨«re just not going to get there because the only way to do it 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 by controlling where the jobs are, you need to have 5 (billion dollars) to $10 billion 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 more a year for NASA‹¨«s budget. And they tried that three times, trying to get that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 huge NASA budget increase, and it isn‹¨«t going to happen. And so three times in a row 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,046 we failed, and so there‹¨«s still people grasping on that they can have that central plan controlled 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,646 approach controlling all the strings. Well, is that a‹¨«is that simply 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 a communications problem, getting the public to be aware of that so that if the members 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,712 of Congress are holding it back, or is it simply those members‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 I think we should just use the systems we used for every other aspect of society, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 which is allow the private sector‹¨«don‹¨«t compete with them; incentivize them by driving 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,712 technologies that will be necessary for us as we explore further. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 This is not a new concept. In the late ‹¨«80s, when I was at the National Space Society, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 a board meeting where a NASA rep was talking about what they‹¨«re doing in the space shuttle, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 and its importance. And she was using the analogy of the canals versus when the railway 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 came. And I‹¨«ll never forget Marvin Minsky, who was on our board, said, yes, this is a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 very important analogy, and obviously if you allowed the railroads to go we would get to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 the West Coast faster than if you build canals. But you, my dear, are supporting the canals. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 But NASA sees themselves as being cutting edge when that‹¨«s not really where it is 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 these days. And for a long time we didn‹¨«t have outside investors willing to take on 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 the human explorational part. NASA has done a terrific job with utilizing commercial and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,379 the military, utilizing commercial resources‹¨«could always do more, but things like comms positioning‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 Right. ‹¨«and a lot of data that comes for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 our sciences now will be more and more delivered by the private sector, companies like Planet 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 Labs, who are able to do this for pennies on a dollar of what Landsat, which NASA is 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 still trying to get a billion (dollars) to $2 billion a year to fund for a lot less resolution 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 of data. It will come. It has come in other areas. And human spaceflight, with the advent 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,579 of a commercial crew program, is, I think, next. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 What‹¨«s interesting to me within especially the private investment space is 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 obviously a lot of the companies you mention are run by just very wealthy people who have‹¨«just 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 might have an interest in it, but are there companies that are doing‹¨«and I guess one 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 of their goals‹¨«that are doing things commercially where it‹¨«s actually‹¨«it‹¨«s just going 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,646 to be a good company versus just‹¨« Well, there‹¨«s just‹¨«there is but 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,246 there‹¨«s‹¨« Boeing. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,779 Right. Yeah, there is companies‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 There are. ‹¨«putting strategic investments in. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 There is the philanthro-capitalists, the people who have made a lot of money elsewhere and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 want to put it in space to make a difference and make a little money, but there‹¨«s also 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 venture capital funds. Lori mentioned Planet Labs. They raised on the order of about $180 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 million from venture capitalists. There‹¨«s a bunch of innovation going on and private 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,246 investors looking at this sector as a new place to invest and make money. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,846 Yeah. Sierra Nevada is another one. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 People‹¨«I mean, I know Planet Lab is basically three scruffy guys from Silicon 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:12,979 Valley. Come on. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 It‹¨«s gotten bigger, right‹¨«(laugher)‹¨«but that‹¨«s how it started. And they were able 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,246 to go out, because they had a good idea‹¨« Right. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,712 ‹¨«and raise the money. There‹¨«s a lot‹¨«there‹¨«s many dozens 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 of companies just below the radar raising real money, building real hardware, flying 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 real hardware, and that‹¨«s the future. That‹¨«s actually fundamentally American. We‹¨«re the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 land of free enterprise. We can open space using a partnership between the best of government 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 and the best of private industry. And that study I mentioned, we can put a permanent 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 base on the Moon to industrialize, to mine the Moon for propellant to open up the Solar 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 System. And we can do it within NASA‹¨«s existing budget, but it would just require we change 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 how we do space. And NASA‹¨«s already proved we can do this. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 We‹¨«ve done it with space station cargo delivery and we‹¨«re doing it with crew transportation 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 to space station. And that is‹¨«there is bipartisan agreement on this. This is a program that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 was created‹¨«the commercial crew cargo program was created in the Bush 43 administration, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 and it was doubled down by President Obama. And actually, it was‹¨«most people forget, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,646 Newt Gingrich publicly praised President Obama when he did that. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 So there is bipartisan agreement on it, and it‹¨«s really the‹¨«it‹¨«s not about partisan. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 It‹¨«s a battle between the dynamicists versus the status quo. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 It‹¨«s parochial, not partisan‹¨« Right. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 ‹¨«I like to say. And it isn‹¨«t an either/or with government and commercial. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 They work together. They have. The private sector has built everything that NASA has 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 developed. They really don‹¨«t build a lot of their own but just looking to play a role 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 that is more of an incentive for our industry to recognize we are them; we are together. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 It‹¨«s not either/or. It was difficult at the time that Elon announced he was building 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 a larger rocket, and the NASA people would say, come on, Lori, you‹¨«ve got to talk to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,846 Elon because we got out of the low-Earth orbit rocket, we‹¨«re giving him that, but we‹¨«you‹¨«ve 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,046 got to get him out of the long-term deep space, because that‹¨«s ours. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 I said, ah, fundamentally you just don‹¨«t understand the paradigm that is we‹¨«re not 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 in a race‹¨«in a lane in a swimming pool that everybody is racing against each other with 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 our own industry. We‹¨«re in maybe a cycling race where we should be running point in the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 government with others drafting behind us, and if someone comes alongside because they 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 can pass us because they found a better way, we don‹¨«t get out our tire pump and stick 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 them in the spokes. You know, we take the next hill that will help them go even farther. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Let me defend NASA a little bit in a couple of dimensions. First of all, when 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 you‹¨«re talking about humans going into space with government sponsorship, it has to be 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,712 conservative. You can‹¨«t risk human life. That‹¨«s another great point. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 I mean, you know, Virgin Galactic can have a problem, as they did on SpaceShipTwo, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 with a design flaw, and they keep going. If there were another shuttle-like accident in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,112 human spaceflight, very‹¨« So that‹¨«s another thing that holds 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,046 us back. Now I am in the aviation world working with the pilots. And you look at how the development 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 of aviation occurred, and you had, early on, the government-sponsored project being‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 Airmail. Well, the first project being for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 flight of Langley. They were government-backed. And he drilled it into the Potomac. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,046 Yep. The Wright Brothers, no government 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 money, in fact couldn‹¨«t convince the government to buy even after they flew their airplanes 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 until they went to France, and finally that was adopted. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 So the innovations were made by the private sector and accidents happened often. And people 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 got back up and got on the planes. Had those been government-developed, that might have 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,646 been‹¨« That might have been a different 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,379 outcome. ‹¨«different. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 Right. But building on that, after the Wright Brothers we had this great partnership 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 with the NACA, the predecessor of NASA‹¨« Yes. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 ‹¨«and private industry, and lots of people died. And we have the world‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 leading aviation industry in part because we figured out how to mix the brilliant genius 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 of American entrepreneurs like Bill Boeing and Glenn Martin with the leadership and the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 research and the advanced technologies that NACA developed and melded together. We had 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 lost world leadership and we surpassed and regained world leadership because of that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 partnership. And that‹¨«s what we can do in human spaceflight. And, you know, people are 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,846 still at risk in aviation or in space. There‹¨«s a way of doing it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,112 Right. Well, you say‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,979 Yeah, Boeing took a big risk on the yet, but it was theirs. It wasn‹¨«t the government‹¨«s. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 Right. Yeah. You say ‹¨«partnership.‹¨« That will require NASA. I mean, I get asked‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,112 Yes. ‹¨«do we need NASA? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 Absolutely. And the answer is we need a NASA. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,579 We need a government organization to take the risks that the private sector‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,912 Yes. ‹¨«won‹¨«t take. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,112 And let‹¨«s just‹¨« And there‹¨«s a lot of good people 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,312 and capabilities there too. And let‹¨«s just say there‹¨«s another 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 geopolitical purpose akin to Apollo that the nation‹¨«s leadership, the elected leadership, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 decides to do. That should be government-led. Of course they should do it in partnership 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 in the most efficient way with the private sector they can, but they would lead, for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 this country, that effort, whether that is a lunar return, a mission to Mars, current 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 plans for an asteroid. That is entirely appropriate. But we don‹¨«t just do it to do it or because 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,579 someone grew up wanting to do it. Yeah. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 We do it for a geopolitical purpose. Right. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 Well, in that sense, how is‹¨«how is the space program‹¨«how is it or can it 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 be linked to foreign policy? I mean, should we be doing it alone? Should all these efforts 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,846 be joint? Well, first of all, we can‹¨«t do 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 it alone. And there is capability all over the world. I mean, India sent a mission to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 Mars. The United Arab Emirates are getting ready to do the same and forming a space agency. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 China has become the third country to be able to send people in space. They should be involved 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,446 in the space station at some point not very distant from now. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 Well, we could be a carrot or a stick. And we‹¨«ve been a carrot on the space station. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 We have brought the Russians in. I was at NASA at that time. In the Clinton era we probably 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 wouldn‹¨«t have had the space station continue without restructuring it to include the Russians. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 We have been the stick with Apollo, with Apollo-Soyuz. We were planning to do more joint missions, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,246 and when they went into Afghanistan we stopped doing that. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 So with China right now the Hill has said we cannot cooperate, coordinate our space 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 activities with them, so we are a public policy tool in the negative. But I think most people 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 in space would like it to again be a carrot and hold it out there as a way we could work 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 together peacefully. Well, because‹¨«I mean, in Apollo 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,512 we led through achievement. I mean, it was sending a message of U.S. power‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 Right. ‹¨«and U.S. leadership. In today‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 world you‹¨«d lead through partnerships. You are the leading partner. You know, I was a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 supporter of President Obama both in ‹¨«08 and ‹¨«12. I‹¨«m disappointed that he has 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 not gone out, as President Reagan did in 1984, and at the presidential level say, let‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 work together for space exploration. I think that‹¨«s‹¨«you know, starting from the top 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 down there‹¨«s a lot of bottoms-up conversations about cooperation, what it would take, but 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,379 we need top-down leadership‹¨« Right. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 ‹¨«in order to make that happen. Let me‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 Well, to support that‹¨«sorry‹¨«you really have to have a capability. So the president 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 can say, hey, I have this particular geopolitical need, and NASA is going to say, well, we could 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 get there‹¨«and I believe it has to be within 10 years for a cost of somewhat less than 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 5 percent of the federal budget‹¨«and as an agency or a space community could offer to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,779 be helpful. At this point we have not gotten there. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 I think there‹¨«s a great geopolitical opportunity for returning to the Moon. Right 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 now NASA‹¨«s focused on Mars to the exclusion of the Moon, but all our international partners 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 want to go to the Moon. We‹¨«ve been to the Moon but Japan has not, Europe has not, the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 Canadians have not, and they all want to go to the Moon. The director of ESA wants to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 go to the Moon. The head of the Canadian Space Agency has made remarks they want to go to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 the Moon. Japan would prefer to go to the Moon. And they quietly are telling us they 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 would like to go back to the Moon with America as a partner. And we‹¨«ve been politely telling 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,779 them that we‹¨«re not going to do that. Not exactly true. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 We have. We have said we‹¨«re not going to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,646 lead. We could have a strategy to go back 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,912 to the Moon today that would fit within our budget‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,046 Have you said that? ‹¨«and establish a permanent base 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 there. And that would be, I think, the ultimate shining city on the hill and could, you know, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 really achieve some national geopolitical objectives. It would send a great message 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,446 around the world. So just to follow up‹¨«and we‹¨«ll 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 get to the audience in a second‹¨«what is keeping these countries from going by themselves 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 right now? So of all‹¨«you know, people complain 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 that NASA doesn‹¨«t have a large enough budget, but if you total up every other nation‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 space budget on the planet, they equal about three-quarters of NASA. So we are in the lead. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 We have a good head start. And I believe if we structure it, as I said, just a little 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,112 bit, we would be running even faster, cooperating with other countries. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 When we had our initial rollout of our 2011 plan and budget, I went overseas to sell it 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 and they were all very interested in the new strategy, and it would have likely led to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 Mars only through the Moon. But when we had this political reaction to other programs 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 being cut, the demand was for a destination. Within the budget we did not have enough for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 a lander for the Moon, so the president picks an asteroid. We certainly didn‹¨«t have enough 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,646 to go to Mars. So it was just a budget reality, not a ‹¨«we‹¨«ll 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 never go to the Moon again‹¨« policy, but it has ended up‹¨«I think because the leadership 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 at NASA currently is more interested in Mars and they want to build this big rocket, and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,712 the justification has to be something. I mean, if you listen to Charlie 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Bolden, the NASA administrator, the language has changed over the past couple of years 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 to saying: We‹¨«re ready to help people go back to the Moon. We‹¨«re going to build a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 big rocket. We‹¨«re just not going to have the money to build the lander. But if somebody 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 else builds the lander, we‹¨«d be happy to be a partner in return to the Moon. And I, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,446 frankly, personal view, I think that that would be the smart way to proceed. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 And so why aren‹¨«t they, just like we aren‹¨«t? What is the purpose? What is 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 going to cause your nation‹¨«s citizens to say, yeah, I want to put my money into this 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 so we can be the, you know, seventh nation to the Moon and send someone? You need to, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 I think, address that. Most other space programs, even though they‹¨«re a lot smaller than us 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 to begin with, have even a smaller portion of them for human spaceflight. They‹¨«re very 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,046 focused on earth sciences and those benefits that return to society‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 Direct applications‹¨« ‹¨«more visibly. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,579 ‹¨«to their citizens. Yes. Yes. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 Right. So with that, we invite audience members to join in the discussion. So please 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 wait for the microphone and speak directly into it. Please stand, state your name and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 affiliation, and try to keep questions and comments concise to allow as many members 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,446 as possible to speak. Yes, sir. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 Q: Rob Quartel with NTELX. And we have nothing to do with space, but I have a geopolitical 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 question. I grew up just outside Cape Canaveral. My father started there in 1957, spent 35 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 years, designed the VAB. So I grew up on all this. And I think all this new stuff is incredibly 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 exciting, the private-sector stuff. The geopolitical‹¨«you mentioned the Europeans, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 the Japanese, and the Canadians and the rest. What about the Chinese? You know, two thirds 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 of the planet has been born since we went to the Moon. And the remainder, half of them 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 don‹¨«t believe we really went. So when the Chinese go, if they will‹¨«and I‹¨«m asking 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 for an assessment‹¨«everybody‹¨«s going to think they were first. So talk about the Chinese 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,446 and those guys. I believe that we will go back before 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 the Chinese go, personally, or we‹¨«ll go with them. I think we have the capability 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 well beyond the Chinese. They have basically purchased their space program from Russia. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 They aren‹¨«t innovating like we are in this country yet. But they will get there. And 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 their interest and these other nations in going to the Moon will likely inspire us to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 go back. And I think we will do it in a way that hopefully is sustainable, and potentially 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,512 cooperative, depending on where this nation‹¨«s relationship goes with China. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 The Chinese in human spaceflight have done exactly what they‹¨«ve said they 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 were going to do in 1992. They set out a program. They‹¨«ve executed that program. They‹¨«ve 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 said they‹¨«re going to build a medium-size space station in the early 2020s; every reason 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 to think that‹¨«s what they‹¨«re going to do. They have not yet said they intend to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 send people to the Moon. It‹¨«s the‹¨«I hate to use the word logical next step; it has 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 a history to it. But any country that sends people into space eventually is going to want 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 them to go somewhere. And the Moon is just an offshore island. So, I mean, it‹¨«s just 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,046 logic that‹¨« But they‹¨«re about where we were 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,712 in the Gemini program. That‹¨«s right. They‹¨«re back in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,912 the ‹¨«60s. You have two geopolitical choices 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 here, and I think there‹¨«s not been discussion about that, where you could return to the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 Moon. One would be a return to the Moon with your‹¨«most of the existing partners of the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 ISS, basically to send something consistent with our values that we‹¨«re going to be founded 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 on democracies that also use free enterprise. And you can do the Moon in that way. That 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 was the result of the study. You could do that. That‹¨«s a geopolitical choice to send 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 the message that we‹¨«re going to be‹¨«the future of humanity is free enterprise and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,179 free democracy. Another one, which is also a geopolitical 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 choice, is to go back and bring China and Russia into the partnership as well. You start 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 with the president and the Congress. Which geopolitical choice do they want to make? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 And I think it‹¨«s actually easier for a Republican to make the latter choice. It was Nixon who 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 went to China, right? It was Nixon who did Apollo-Soyuz. I think it would have been more 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 difficult for this president to do something like Apollo-Soyuz or do something with the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 Chinese, you know, and our crew system docking in space. But if it‹¨«s a Republican, it makes 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 it a little easier. So you start with the geopolitical choice. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 Is that a campaign speech for a Republican president? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,446 I‹¨«m just saying‹¨« We‹¨«ve got to fill our potholes first. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 No, it was not a campaign speech. So it‹¨«s‹¨«I‹¨«m just saying it‹¨«d probably 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 be easier for a Republican to partner with the Chinese, you know. That doesn‹¨«t mean 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,779 they would want to, OK. It depends on who you pick. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 Yeah. All right. So those are the two choices. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,446 Pick your geopolitical choice and then you can have a program to support it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,846 Yes, sir. Q: David Aaron, RAND Corporation. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 I have two questions, really. One is just a factual question. What is the comparative 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 size of the expenditures of NASA and our private sector? Do they compare? Are they‹¨«I‹¨«d 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 just be interested in getting a sense‹¨« In space? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,112 Q: Huh? In space? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,846 Q: Yes. You have to put a discount on that, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 because there‹¨«s one big private application of space that makes lots of money, and therefore 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 spends a lot of money to make it, which is communication satellites. That‹¨«s a big slice 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 of spending, which really isn‹¨«t counted as space, even though the relays‹¨«the satellites 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 are in space. If you take that away, what would be the guess 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 of private-sector space spending? And defining what you mean by private, there‹¨«s‹¨«it excludes 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 selling to government, which is mainly where SpaceX is going, for example. I would say 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,046 order of what, $3 (billion) or $4 billion a year maybe? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,179 Q: So that‹¨«s compared to‹¨« It depends how you account for it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 The total global‹¨«if you add what John just suggested excluding‹¨«the Space Foundation 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 has an annual report‹¨«it approaches $200 billion a year of total revenue with all the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 different parts of the different commercial space program. And so the commercial part, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 if you count everything, is larger than the government. But if you don‹¨«t count things 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 like telecom, like DirecTV, which is the biggest application, which is tens of billions of 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,712 dollar of revenue that‹¨«s going into that, then it‹¨«s a much different answer. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 And that sort of makes the point. I mean, it‹¨«s hundreds of billions of dollars 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 that we get. It‹¨«s an export industry. This is something that this nation does well, and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,646 we‹¨«re in the lead in the private sector as well as government. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 And the idea would be the private sector does it for less, right? So even if 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,112 it‹¨«s‹¨« Q: In principle. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 Even if they‹¨«re doing the exact same thing, the idea would be that they‹¨«re 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,712 going to spend less. Q: My second question is, I‹¨«ve been struck 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 by all this discussion of geopolitical objectives for the space program. What about scientific 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 objectives? I haven‹¨«t heard a word about that as being something that was actually 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 important and, in fact, motivates, I think, a lot of people out of school, anyway, to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 go into the space program. And since that is not a money maker necessarily, how can 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 you ask the private sector, which has to look at the bottom line at some point, even in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 the future, to do the kinds of things that a nonprofit organization like NASA can devote 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 its efforts to? So we all talked about how the focus 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 of this discussion on the human spaceflight program, that NASA does a lot of really valuable 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 things, other things, and science is one of those. The science programs at NASA‹¨«earth 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 science, aeronautics, space science‹¨«make up half of their budget. So that‹¨«s a fabulous 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 thing. Human spaceflight has never been about science. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 I know we like to use it every now and then. And the very last astronaut we sent to the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 Moon was, in fact, a geologist. But you don‹¨«t spend those amounts of public-sector money 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 for science. I think NSF‹¨«s budget in its entirety is less than NASA‹¨«s, the whole 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 National Science Foundation. So just the area‹¨« That‹¨«s much less than the total 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,712 NASA. So just the area of science that you 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 can study in space would be a fraction of that if you didn‹¨«t have this glory attached 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,779 to it. I mean, we‹¨«re spending $6 billion 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 a year on robotic space science. If you took that out from under the cover of the broader 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 human spaceflight public interest, whether you would get $6 billion a year on scientific 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 payoff compared to other areas of science is arguable. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 And I would argue NASA could do it in a way that gets a lot more science for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 the dollar by partnering with the private sector. A lot of the data we have the capability 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 of getting from commercial satellites could provide scientific learning for people. And 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 we‹¨«re starting to do more and more of that. Another thing; it‹¨«s not either-or 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 with science or commerce. You know, lower costs, routine, reliable commercial services, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 you enable a lot of good science at much lower cost. So if you had a return to the Moon that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 was enabled by commercial partnerships, you‹¨«re going to do a whole bunch of science on the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 Moon. NASA could send astronauts to the Moon like it sends to the space station, on commercial 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 rockets, at much lower cost. And then they could do a ton of science at the Moon. You 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 could put a radio telescope on the far side of the Moon; a lot of people would like to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,446 do. There is a lot to do. So there is a win-win there where you can do both. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 The Webb telescope alone is a $9 billion science mission that NASA intends to launch 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 in a couple of years. They do a lot of‹¨« 2018. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 ‹¨«science. I saw Webb this week. I was out at 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Goddard Space Flight Center. It‹¨«s going to be, what, 18 mirrors and a very elaborate 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 structure. The first mirror is going to be put in next week. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 It‹¨«s sort of‹¨«and it‹¨«s your typical government program. I go see the Webb a lot 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 in its development, and they would show you a map with where we mined for this material 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 here and then shipped it here and then polished it there, and then they had‹¨«and this were 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 all congressional districts. And they considered it a feature, not a bug. I mean, no wonder 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,646 it cost $9 billion. Yeah. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Do you think if we had done that in a different way, we could have it already? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 Which was $8 billion more than projected at the start. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 Not to mention that it took so long that a lot of the science that we‹¨«re getting 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 now from Kepler, you would do things differently. So it‹¨«s one of these that‹¨«s going to pass 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 you along the way if you set your architecture and your technology at a point in time for 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 a 20-year program. That‹¨«s my other problem with setting the architecture now for Mars. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 My criticisms are quite different than those who say, oh, we don‹¨«t have a real program. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 Of course we don‹¨«t. It‹¨«s 20 years away. We should. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,046 Yes, sir. Then we‹¨«ll jump in the back. Yeah. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,312 Q: Banning Garrett, consultant, and Singularity University. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 I‹¨«m very interested in all you‹¨«ve been saying. And one of the things you‹¨«I think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 I‹¨«d love to see you elaborate on is sort of the disruptive technologies coming from 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 the private sector. And you‹¨«ve mentioned CubeSats, which there‹¨«s no money in them 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,046 for Boeing and Lockheed compared to billion-dollar satellites, right. And it‹¨«s totally disruptive. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,379 They can do so many new things now much more cheaply, and a lot more of it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 I‹¨«ve also worked with the Made In Space people, who put the first 3-D printer on the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 space station, as you well know. What‹¨«s interesting there is why wasn‹¨«t that done 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 by Lockheed? Because there‹¨«s no money in it. I mean, and they did it for $2 (million), 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 $3 million. It‹¨«s three guys came out of Singularity in 2010, created a little company 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 with the help of NASA. Pete Worden and those guys figured out how to do a zero-G printer, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,646 put it on the station. But the whole point was their idea is you 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 can‹¨«t really go into space seriously if you can‹¨«t make stuff in space. You have 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 to haul it all out of the gravity well of Earth, already made, and be able to withstand 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 nine Gs of gravity. If you can make it in space, it can be lighter, faster, better, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 et cetera. So they built a printer that can print in a vacuum, so you could extrude huge 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 structures. And if you want to go to Mars and the Moon, you could send robotic printers 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 to build the structures before you ever get there. I mean, it‹¨«s a whole different way 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 of doing things. It seems a bit of a threat to the traditional space Mafia, as somebody 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,846 once called it in the Pentagon to me. And I wonder what you think, because I think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 that‹¨«s a lot of what‹¨«s happening is a new way of doing things and getting things 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 done that might not have been possible in the past and greatly lower the cost if you 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,512 can make stuff in space instead of haul it out. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 And that‹¨«s a good‹¨«how much control do the bigger companies that are in the private 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 sector, the Lockheeds and Boeings and others, how much are they controlling that side of 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 things compared to the small startups? Almost entirely. That is the military-industrial 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 complex. And you would see some of those briefings are so exciting. Even an astronaut briefed 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,846 on using lunar material with robotics that could generate more robots to build whatever‹¨«whether 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 it be the telescopes we wanted in space. You have in-space refueling that would radically 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 change the architecture that you would use. And these are not unobtainium. These are things 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 that you could actually invest in and do. And I just‹¨«it‹¨«s not different than other 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,979 sectors. IBM did not innovate first, but they‹¨«re there. And they‹¨«re still around, and they‹¨«re 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 making more money. So I absolutely believe the major companies will do this. And it‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,846 going to take‹¨« Grudgingly. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,046 ‹¨«some of the smallers to lead. But they‹¨«ll do it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,979 But that‹¨«s, by the way, what is going to keep them sharp and competitive internationally. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 We aren‹¨«t helping Lockheed and Boeing by just giving them a cost-plus contract to do 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 something that was invented 70 years ago. We are not helping U.S. competitiveness. We 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,846 are holding them back. And so to really drive that, we‹¨«ve got just a blessing of industrialists 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,846 of the day who are investing in this. And that is causing everybody to be sharper. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 An example of this is Jeff Bezos. He‹¨«s one of the great disrupters of our 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 time. And he went out and built an engine for his company, Blue Origin. He‹¨«s got a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 secretive rocket company. And he went to a company, one of the big considered old-space 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 companies, United Launch Alliance, which was in trouble from Elon, which‹¨«being disrupted, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 and he brought his engine in that was far ahead in development. And United Launch Alliance 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 got a new CEO who said I‹¨«m going to use that engine and build a new launch vehicle; 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 shifted the whole culture of the company in the last 24 months. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 So that‹¨«s where a big, previously old-school company is adjusting. But at the same time, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 it‹¨«s really interesting. Aerojet, which had refused to spend $500 million to invest 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 in the rocket engine because they were waiting for the U.S. government to pay for the development, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 went and spent the $500 billion buying another company called Pratt & Whitney. If they had 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 spent it on the engine, then ULA would probably be using their engine today. So they were 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 using old-style tactics, and Aerojet is in serious threat of maybe going out of business 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 because their customer left them and just recently announced they‹¨«re not going to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 buy solid-rocket motors from them either. So there‹¨«s a lot of disruption going on 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 in the space industry today in a variety of different sectors. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 And as with all of evolution, the earlier adopters get the best chance of succeeding. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 So‹¨«(laughs)‹¨«I love to see Boeing in our commercial crew, because they know how to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 do it with airplanes, they take risks with public transportation every day, and they 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,779 are doing a great job. The lady in the back. Then we‹¨«ll 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 move forward. Q: Leonor Tomero with House Armed Services 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,446 Committee. Leonor Tomero with House Armed Services Committee. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 So, piggybacking on this fascinating discussion about the revolution in the private sector 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 with the advent of Black Sky, Planet Labs, where do you see the role for government then? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 Is it just to stand aside and reap the benefits? Or are there‹¨«is there something that government 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 can do to further facilitate the success of these companies, more launch opportunities? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,179 What are the challenges? And should government help or stay on the side? 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 Let me stick in just a point. She‹¨«s coming from House Armed Services Committee. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 We haven‹¨«t talked at all about how innovative or non-innovative the national security space 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 sector is. I mean, there‹¨«s as much money there as there is in NASA of government money. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 Is that old space? Is there innovation there? Yeah. They‹¨«re going through the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 same challenges. They are benefiting from the lower launch class, which is fabulous, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 because that‹¨«s our nation‹¨«s budget and the safety and security of our men and women 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 overseas. They are buying commercial data‹¨«like 70 percent of their comms are bought commercially 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,846 now. I was trying to get NASA to do that. But we‹¨«re more special. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 And the‹¨«so I see a classic role like the NACA was for space and aeronautics development 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 now for space. Of course there‹¨«s a role. There‹¨«s the science role. And there‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 that cutting-edge technology and buying down the risk. And there‹¨«s even markets. The 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 Air Mail Act that allowed airlines to get their real start are things we could be doing. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 We can pay to fly our astronauts on vehicles that are taking other people as well and our 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 stuff, hosted payloads. We have a tremendous amount that NASA could be doing. And I think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 that‹¨«s some of the fear at NASA. You grow up and you love this and you don‹¨«t want 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 it to go away. It doesn‹¨«t go away. And you embrace all of the things that they will enable. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 They come more enabling than just doing it themselves. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 NASA‹¨«s greatest days are ahead of it. Everybody is looking in the mirror, pining 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 for Apollo. I fundamentally believe that NASA‹¨«s greatest achievements are in front of us. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 They are, in my opinion, the long-term planning committee for the human race. And they need 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,846 to do it in partnership with every part of America and our international partners. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 But we don‹¨«t have‹¨«private industry is very short-term thinking, five-year time horizons. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 We need somebody who‹¨«s thinking long term and making long-term investments in the technologies 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 and capabilities and the science. And that is a good fit with the driving innovation 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 and push that you get from private industry. We need to figure out how to make them work 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 together. And that‹¨«s when we achieve greatness for America in general, but the human race 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,379 more broadly. Robert. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 Q: I‹¨«m Bob Bestani from National Defense University. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 So I‹¨«m wondering if you could sort of distill all of this and, you know, pretend you‹¨«re 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 a king for however period of time you want to be. Where‹¨«s the ideal point? How would 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 you restructure things so that, you know, we have an ideal point in the future? How 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,646 would you structure that? In what universe? (Laughter.) 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,912 Q: This current one. I mean, when we‹¨«re‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 Q: We‹¨«re talking about space, any universe. Well, I know. But we‹¨«re talking 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 about public money allocated through a political system. And that puts constraints on your 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 freedom to innovate. If you take away those constraints and say, in an ideal world, we 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 would have a coherent national strategy that relates to national security space, government 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,579 space, commercial space, allocates roles, responsibilities, creates synergies. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Here we have a bunch of separate places with no central coordination and embedded in a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 political system that makes change very hard. Lori will‹¨«how do I want to say this? We 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 used to have central authorities in the White House. We used to have a thing called a space 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 council that was set up to do that kind of planning. The resistance to doing it was too 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 strong, so it didn‹¨«t really work. But some central‹¨«I mean, at this point in the White 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 House structure there are about three people that care about space. And they fight fires 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 every hour. They don‹¨«t do long-term strategic planning. And that‹¨«s not the way to get 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,512 a coherent policy. I think that‹¨«s a piece of it. But 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 for what NASA would actually be doing, you don‹¨«t have to look much farther than the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 budget request in 2011, that really brought down some of the long-term needs that any 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 exploration program would have‹¨«a cheaper engine that you could operate for much less 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,979 cost across government. The military would love to have this as well. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,112 Looking at what we call 21st century infrastructure, which meant tearing down old expensive buildings 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 and making sure that NASA was using facilities that they needed, not finding programs to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 fit large expensive facilities, and doing flagship missions that are unique in that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,779 they drive technology. It‹¨«s OK if they fail. You do things like use solar electric propulsion, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 optical communications, which then can have tremendous benefits for the nation and the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 world and our own industry; being able to reestablish NASA as a lead, I think, internationally, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 reaching out to cooperate with others, deciding on a human exploration strategy that will 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 include more people than just us, and finding the unique ways to go that will leave behind 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 societal benefits. I think it is absolutely what we will be doing over time. It‹¨«s just 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 we‹¨«re at the struggle between folks who, of course, always want to fight harder to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 keep something than anybody new to get it, because we don‹¨«t know who‹¨«s going to win 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 in the new day. There are two gentlemen in the back 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,579 that I think had a question. We can do just two questions in a row and then‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 Q: Paul Stimers with K&L Gates. And Leonor, thank you. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 The question of what government can do, I think, has been answered over the last couple 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 of weeks with a lot of work leading up to it. Congress just passed the U.S. Commercial 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which, among other things, helps create and extend and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 expand a regulatory regime that is designed to help make sure that the commercial space 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 industry can launch safely, effectively, routinely, quickly. And creating that kind of a regime 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 is vitally important. And that was a big step forward. That‹¨«s going to go to the president 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,246 later this week. And I think part of that includes kind of 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 a sweeping provision that recognizes property rights in space. If you go to an asteroid 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 or another location in space and obtain resources from there, according to this act, the U.S. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 government says that‹¨«s yours. That is an element of certainty that can unlock invest 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 and can provide the kind of opportunity that develops these capabilities without relying 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 on taxpayer money. Lori, thank you for all of the scars that 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 you‹¨«ve endured throughout this process, and the rest of you on the panel. It‹¨«s been 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 quite a journey to get to where we are. And I agree that the future is looking very bright 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,446 for the partnership between the commercial industry and NASA. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 It has been a privilege and an honor. Thank you. Space property rights is on my 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 list of things, like the Homestead Act, that the government did back to inspire and incentivize 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 innovation that they can do hard work to get that done. But those are exactly the kinds 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 of things government can do. But, of course, NASA wants to actually be more of a part of 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 it. And there are plenty of those things as well. And driving down those risks that‹¨«in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 space propellant transfer, I just can‹¨«t believe you haven‹¨«t talked about. This was 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 Charles‹¨« thing. He really, really ran it hard while he was at NASA. And it would be 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 a game changer for space exploration, driving down the cost, and so forth. But the forces 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,979 that want to launch big rockets don‹¨«t want to do it. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 Propellant transfer would be a revolutionary technology. It would take all our‹¨«rather 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 than building a new rocket, we can achieve most of our goals in space using existing 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 launch vehicles from United Launch Alliance, from SpaceX. And what you need to do is propellant 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 storage and transfer. And what most people don‹¨«t realize is 80 percent of the mass 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 that you need to launch off the planet to go to the Moon or go to Mars is propellant. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,846 And if you can launch it up in smaller parts on smaller rockets and just transfer the propellant, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 kind of like we do with transporting gasoline to gas stations. We don‹¨«t take some huge 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 monster truck to the gas station and do it all in one, you know, mission. You have multiple 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 missions and you transfer the propellant. If we do the same thing in space, it has a 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 dramatic reduction in the cost of getting into space. And that was a core assumption 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 in the study I reported that we just completed for NASA. And it saves‹¨«it reduces the cost 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 of returning to the Moon by about an order of magnitude. So there‹¨«s huge benefits there. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 Let me react to the comment about property rights, because it‹¨«s a good Council 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 on Foreign Relations type question. The U.S., through its legislation, has unilaterally 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 declared property rights in space. There‹¨«s no U.N. treaty or any other international 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 agreement on property rights. It‹¨«s a unilateral action. Does that mean we‹¨«re going to lead 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 to form an international consensus by action? Or is it that we‹¨«re being kind of a rogue 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 in doing that? I don‹¨«t know what the answer to that is, but it‹¨«s an interesting activity. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 The bill that Paul was talking about is actually a very smartly formed bill. And 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 I commend the author of the original bill. It was‹¨«we are going to recognize the resources 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,112 you mine that are yours, consistent with international law. So it‹¨«s very modeled after the existing 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 outer-space treaty, existing international treaties, where you get a slot in geosynchronous. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,979 We recognize your right to broadcast from there without interference. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 And so what this bill basically says is we‹¨«re going to recognize your right to use those 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 resources and mine resources without interference and have a productive activity and, you know, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 so to have a contract to sell them. And it‹¨«s also based on international common law, where 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 precedents have been set where the United States brought rocks back from the Moon, the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 Russians did the same, and we traded them. So we‹¨«re allowing commercial companies to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 do something similar to those other precedents. So we have time for probably one 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 more question. Before we take it‹¨«and then it‹¨«ll be you in a second‹¨«but I‹¨«d just 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 remind everyone that this meeting has been on the record, so everything said here can 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 be held against you in a court of law. (Laughter.) If anybody‹¨«s paying attention. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,779 (Laughter.) Yes, sir. Yeah. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 Q: David Wertime with Foreign Policy Magazine. I can‹¨«t resist asking this question. What 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,912 changes in everything you‹¨«ve been discussing if we discover extraterrestrial life? In particular 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 I‹¨«m thinking of a, you know, relatively simple life form. How does that change in 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 particular the political calculus? How does it remove some of the political constraints 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 that you‹¨«ve been talking about? Thanks. So extraterrestrial non-sentient life, 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 we‹¨«ve sort of run the experiment. I think most scientists who have studied it believe 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,379 there was, at least in the past, life on Mars. And it hasn‹¨«t changed much. I was at NASA 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 in the ‹¨«90s when we thought we had found the Allan Hills fossil with life in it. And 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 I remember thinking it would change everything. And it was a headline for two days. And this 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 is long before the scientific process worked through where there was a lot of debate and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,712 determined not likely that it was a fossilized life form. But we ran the experiment politically 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,579 and publicly, and it didn‹¨«t change a lot. I think intelligent life is an entirely different 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 construct. I thought two major disrupters externally‹¨«either finding intelligent life 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 or an incoming asteroid with a likelihood to hit us‹¨«is what would incentivize the 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 world to motivate to expand our efforts in either of those regards. But I don‹¨«t think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 that biological life does. If anything, it might keep you from going, because there‹¨«s 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,646 a lot of people who feel that should be allowed to develop on its own and we would contaminate 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,712 it. There is quite a few people that think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,112 that if humans‹¨«if we discover microbes on Mars, there will be a lot of resistance to 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,579 allowing humans to go to Mars and make it a lot more difficult. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:18,512 And if you discover evidence of intelligent life in an exoplanet light years away, philosophically 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 it‹¨«s a profound discovery, but you can‹¨«t do much about it at least until we get warp 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,379 drive or something similar. And we‹¨«re not quite there yet. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,046 The most immediate political thing to probably break out is the fight over do 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,246 you send that intelligent extraterrestrial life a signal, and you want‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,179 We‹¨«ve been sending signals for‹¨« But do you intentionally, say, send 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,846 them a very high-power laser beam with communications to make it highly likely that they‹¨«ll see 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,446 us? And there‹¨«s‹¨«you could be inviting them to come to our Solar System. Maybe they‹¨«re 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,246 more advanced than us. There‹¨«s plenty of science fiction on the potential consequences 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:14,712 of that. Well, but the nearest star is an 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,379 eight-year round trip at the speed of light. So it‹¨«s good to think about. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:15,112 We can‹¨«t go, yeah. We‹¨«re not going. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,179 That‹¨«s a few disruptions away. But it‹¨«s a fascinating topic. 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,912 Unless‹¨«you talked about singularity. Unless we get to the singularity‹¨« 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,046 Right, right, right. Well, on that note, you‹¨«ll all 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,512 go see a big movie coming out, I‹¨«m sure‹¨«it‹¨«s called ‹¨«Star Wars‹¨«‹¨«(laughter)‹¨«and 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:16,979 talk about that. But I want to thank Lori, John, and Charles for joining us. I think 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:17,312 this was a really great discussion. And thank you all for joining us as well. (Applause.) 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:12,979 Thank you. (END) 16:50:11,446 --> 16:50:13,712 This is an uncorrected transcript.
