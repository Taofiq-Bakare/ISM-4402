yeah hello my name is James Leone and this is going to be my presentation on emerging trends in the classroom I want to start out by saying that there are a lot of new technologies that are coming out constantly all the time and it's only natural that students are going to want to try to utilize those whether it be in the classroom or outside of the classroom just some way shape or form they're going to use that technology sometimes as educators we will embrace the technology there's other times where we won't so if there are some teachers that are set in their ways they may not particularly like to use some of that technology or look at it is that the technology is just terrible for the student or not useful for them in some way shape or form for me this really depends on how the students are using it if they're using it to just play around waste time then of course it's not going to be useful in the classroom but if we find a way for them to play around with it and learn something in the process then this can be very useful the first topic I'd like to touch on is going to be social media in the classroom one of the emerging trends is social media but there can sometimes be a statement to it in the opinions of many adults and no matter how it is presented they will always see it as a waste of time sites such as facebook instagram twitter myspace youtube and so on our sites where people can come together to share ideas give opinions share videos pictures etc the downside to this is that social media is a haven for a lot of random negativity as well as far the positive side and the classes that I teach I use a document that's called Google classroom it's basically like a facebook for classes the students can share videos pictures have discussions on there I find it very useful in the sense that it allows the students to collaborate outside of the class where sometimes they might think of something later on outside up there and they're not able to share it but now they're able to do that by posting it on the website itself the negative 2 this is that sometimes students are going to post things that have nothing to do with the subject matter or post something inappropriately I am a music teacher so oftentimes they're posting songs to each other that are inspiring to them or mean something to them but then sometimes they might post something that really has nothing to do with the subject matter or just an inappropriate song to begin with being junior high that I teach oftentimes students are still learning what is acceptable and what does not some things are easy to follow but then for others there's that fine line between appropriate and inappropriate another downside to social media would be that there can be cyberbullying sexual harassment and violence that will take place on these sites with teenagers some cases it's led to depression and even suicide all in all social media can be a wonderful tool if it is used properly in the classroom and the students are educated on how they can use it without harming themselves or harming somebody else in the process the next technology I'd like to talk about would be streaming videos and podcasts live streams pre-recorded streams and podcasts or things that are on the rise as well many students and oftentimes teachers as well will find themselves streaming feeds of just about anything it can be a presentation for a business classroom school or just a concert of a band that you want to see podcast have the same idea but most of the time they are pre-recorded so that they can be edited the biggest plus that I see to this is that it can help a student in areas that they may not have had help or much support in before let's say that a child is sick so they're not able to go to school but maybe they feel well enough that they could still follow a lesson well this is where a live stream can come in the teacher may be able to broadcast the lesson online and the student will be able to be still be a part of the lesson even when they are restricted to their bed maybe they're out of state for something like a family emergency or they have to go out town for something else same situation if they can live stream that lesson they can still be a part of the class even if there are a hundred miles away now the downside to this is that when they find streams or podcast oftentimes it may not be related to what they're learning there are podcasts for everything from fan boards of video games movies all the way up to adult themed casts if a child finds themselves listening to some of these it can really sidetrack them or even warp their minds this is something I would try to avoid naturally in a classroom the Internet is a wide-open place it's my job to try to get them to understand that when you're listening to a podcast to listen to it with a grain of salt because it's people like me and you that are the ones that are presenting that and oftentimes it's just opinions not really based on any kind of fact or any educational purposes the third technology i would like to touch on would be gaming in the classroom now this is one of the biggest double-edged swords are in the technological world there are so many apps and video games that are out there it made your head spin there are app games that are just time killers to play when you're wasting time like waiting for someone or you're laying in bed you're bored you just can't sleep there are also games that are so realistic that it takes you out of reality in some cases is called skids to lose some touch to reality let me talk about the positives to this first there are many educational gaming apps available for math reading writing science and even music these programs will provide provide a simple game for a student to play but it will also teach them something in the process this can be in the form of solving equations or even trivia one such program that I am aware of is called I ready this is an educational assessment program that has many games built into it but in order for the students to advance in the game they have to answer questions correctly let me talk about the downside to these there are way too many games out there that are considered addictive and can cause a person to be distracted we all see it in our everyday lives whether it's a friend or a fan member some kind of acquaintance once they lock into these games they are just absent mentally this can be troublesome for students they already have a short attention span oftentimes so it causes them to get sidetracked and forget about what they're supposed to be learning all in all the technologies can be embraced and treated as a wonderful thing in the classroom but it's up to us as teachers to make sure that we are presenting this information appropriately and that they are utilizing it correctly I would not ever tell a student to just go on the internet and randomly searched a bunch of random things but I would make sure that they're using it to learn because the internet is full of information oftentimes it is incorrect information but oftentimes there are a lot of scholarly articles out there that you can really learn something in the process so more than anything else technology can be a wonderful thing and I just hope that we all as educators use it appropriately and make sure that the students use it appropriately as well thank you very much again my name is James Leone and this was my presentation
