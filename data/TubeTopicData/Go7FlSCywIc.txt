the next thing we're going to talk about is the Internet of Things the Internet of Things or IOT is a concept applied to a broad array of connected applications IOT is impacting our businesses and home life and in many instances connecting the two whether it's welcomed or not what I OT is doing providing is providing automation through if-then than that formulas using a connected network of data collectors communication devices in cloud storage IOT can provide solutions to simple and complex scenarios quickly and accurately IOT is impacting infrastructure in all phases of its life cycle once existing conditions information has been obtained in processed hopefully through the use of a UAV it's time to start designing but first a word of caution from Carl bass our president and CEO of micro desk he says the Internet of Things is like teenage sex everyone is talking about it nobody's really doing it and if they're doing it they're probably doing it badly despite the crude analogy he's kind of right the Internet of Things is very powerful but it's still in its infancy with regards to how we're managing monstrous amounts of data or obtaining and putting it to good use the Internet of Things requires three components the thing which is the physical device or the devices collecting the data connectivity which is this communication or transmission and then the cloud system the cloud system allows the distribution on to those who will use and process the data using this distributed data and information we're able to add our intelligence to plan and design our infrastructure based on real up-to-date data so we're not getting replaced by sensors computers cloud servers BIM software and robotics just yet we will however start seeing programmers and network engineers as part of our project teams to assist in the collection analysis and distribution of data we need to use our experience and intelligence to navigate through the data produced by IOT in order to use it effectively an interesting application of IOT that I'm currently interested in is the extraction of data from vehicle to vehicle or v2 he traffic data applications such as ways to supplement or dare I say replace our traffic studies to plan for our future infrastructure projects more effectively v2v applications are part of the IOT core part of IOT in which data is collected through cell phones and GPS communicated to an application where algorithms are applied in order to deliver solutions such as traffic rerouting delays and traffic time and roadway conditions as IOT emerges the traffic engineer with the right software and expertise and a skilled programmer will be able to extract data from an application and supplement it with additional data traditionally collected in the field the combined data can then be translated into traffic simulations within infraworks 360 to model different scenarios Los Angeles and their recently implemented adaptive signalization equipment is another way IOT data can be extrapolated and modeled in planning software this information can be used to develop evacuation routes and emergencies as well as determine the best scenarios or traffic rerouting for peak traffic conditions London tracks pedestrian and bicycle usage through the use of cameras the technology provides data on how the infrastructure is used in planning and street upgrades as well as widening sidewalks pedestrian signal timing and whether or not warrants are met for modifying infrastructure to accommodate evolving transportation needs as IOT emerges infrastructure planning becomes smarter so what we saw in the video playing in the background there was in four works 360 processing traffic simulations using extrapolated data now it's not there yet the technology but what we should be able to do is provide is extract data from ways in order to supplement traditional data that's being input into info works so providing info works with information maybe on a you know to do some forensic analysis on a particular event would be a useful application of IOT into our existing software so as population grow in in urban centers or infrastructure needs to adapt to suit the needs of the city's inhabitants the most sustainable infrastructure is smart infrastructure that can adapt to it to its change in use it's changing condition or change in environment and not additional infrastructure that needs to be constructed by incorporating data transmitting sensors on our city's infrastructure able to monitor pedestrian and vehicular traffic infrastructure structural integrity utility condition and emergency evacuations and pollution levels the collected data can provide us information on how our infrastructure is being used how its performing or how quickly it needs to be replaced emerging IOT technologies are also improving Public Safety throughout the United States highway bridges are aging and are requiring more inspections to monitor their structural health through the application of network censors bridges now have the ability to communicate their conditions through IOT sensors are attached to the bridge components and communicate through wireless access points to provide remote do team management facilities the most up-to-date accurate information on the bridges integrity reducing the need for potentially unnecessary inspections if the sensors monitor greater deflection that is normally tolerated or measure a decrease in material density faster decisions can be implemented to avoid putting the pub in danger and avoiding catastrophe this technology is not new but it's increased accessibility through merging IOT technologies has generated great adopt greater adoption rates for do tease
