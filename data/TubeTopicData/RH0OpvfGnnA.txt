cannie bot is a smart toy robot that brings the magic of play back into the real world it can be controlled and programmed from a phone or a tablet and used in a large number of place in Aereo's during a racing game canny bart behaves like a smart slot car you only have to control the speed while it automatically sticks to the lake it's even clever enough to find its way back if you happen to come off you can also use cannon bots for other exciting game scenarios like sumo wrestling Chow stick or puzzle solving there is a dedicated app and track design for each game print the tracks at home or use a large format tracks that we supply but why not create a massive track right in your living room using ordinary black tape imagine the play possibilities playing with canny bots is an interactive social experience that brings friends and family together we design cali bots as a construction kit that can be easily assembled at home this gives kids a practical insight into how a functional robot is designed and built the build instructions are beautifully illustrated and laid out in great detail use the high quality vinyl stickers provided to personalize your candy bot it's an incredibly rewarding experience for kids to see their creation come to life now what is play without a bit of learning basic understanding of programming has become an essential skill today but it's not easy to get kids started on programming to help kids take their first steps we created a simple and intuitive app called canny talk it's a sin tax free programming interface that works just like a friendly chat all the text based interface makes it easy for kids to progress to more serious programming languages like Python or Arduino it would be a shame not to make candy bot 3d printable given that your kids may already have access to 3d printing at school or a local library print can evoke shells in vibrant colors or even customize the design using free easy to use CAD software from Autodesk printing a canny bot is one of the best 3d printing projects that you can do with your kids canny bot is at farm hackable toy built by kids it introduces them to programming and leads them to the exciting world of 3d printing and robotics this is the Handy case this is the first born of a generation that will completely revolutionize the handheld device that any case connects directly to the back of an ipad air enabling you to interact with your iPad from the back panel using all of your fingers so you can actually see your hands through the ipad now you can see tap swipe all on screen objects so I'm obscuring the screen with your hands the major obstacle with operating from the back panel is that you can't see your hands so we've done some research on that and we found that people actually and try to add a camera to the back panel or you know they try to use lasers or several other methods but the mobile environments actually very complicated it needs to be able to work in almost any lighting conditions like extreme sunlight you're at the beach or complete darkness when we're at home in bed it needed to be one hundred percent safe for the human body and not to mention it's a mobile device so it has limited battery life all of these things were very complicated obstacles so the concept was actually born in early 2010 with the release the very first iPad my name is Tom long founder of landscape incorporated that was early 2010 when the first iPad came to the market immediately I feel it's happening and why try to select something using my two sons I mean they are too short and I had to use other fingers to do the selection that day I play some tennis so when I flip my hand immediately a few my wrist hurts I started saying why I have to use these two clumsy sums to do the selection while leaving all the others smart fingers just for the holding job I'm already having all these touch points so I started working on it immediately so now we actually have the very first pre-production model for the ipad air and it's ready to go let's it's exciting it's very exciting because we have really revolutionized mobile device experience as soon as the co-founders have joined forces we hit immediately started gaining momentum we had made the top ten most interesting technology list in CES 2014 forbes news CES 2015 and we won the most prestigious startup 21 competition and you know that that's that's really what we're here today so we've always really received a excited welcome from the tech community and I think it every single convention we have really wowed the audience just by showing them what the Handy case can actually do you know it's everybody I can almost still developer general audience and single person really has that enthusiastic excited energy whenever they hold the Handy case for the first time my name Kingsley check as a student annotator music plays a big part of my life after the most teenagers I tend to listen to my music on the louder sign my parents constantly get on my case whenever they hear our music leaking through my headphone something has to change after conduct extensive research we've concluded the exposure that excessively loud sounds or noises in quickly result in permanent hearing damage for example most portable audio voices today contracted salaries equivalent to that of a rock concert at this level permanent hearing damage occur in as little as 15 minutes taking all these factors in consideration we've created the ages pro the industry's first wireless high-performance headphone that will revolutionize auditory safety for you to achieve our vision we have incorporated cutting-edge advanced wireless Bluetooth and active noise cancellation technologies with Ages pro headphones you can enjoy your listening freedom and mobility all the active noise-cancelling system reduces unwanted ambient sounds in noisy environments our headphones also have a state-of-the-art volume limiting and digital signal processing technology our digital decibel equalizer regulates and enhances the volume of the quietest and/or loudest music recordings while the volume limiting function ensures that the audio no matter how high the volume is cranked up stays as safe levels not one but two perfectly tuned speaker drivers a tweeter for the high frequencies and the mid-range hybrid bass driver are engineered to deliver studio quality performance in addition we have added LED indicators that will keep parents updated on their children's listening that ball was fast right but how fast was it hi this is scouting the world's first smart speed radar but let me reduce myself as well my name is Mika I was a baseball pitcher and a member of the Slovenian national baseball team so I spent most of my childhood days on the field an explosive fastball can get a picture into college and help him enter the professional baseball arena so it's extremely important that baseball pictures be able to throw hard today people need tons of equipment to record pitching speeds and other parameters of the pitch to ride them down and record video we believe players parents coaches and scouts deserve a simple and intuitive solution to be able to record performance and track progress every single day that's why we created scouted the world's first smart speed radar Scotty measures the speed of the ball and transfers the collected data to an app on your smartphone or a tablet within the app you can select the type location and result of the pitch the app saves all the data so you can track your progress over time you can even record a video of your pitching technique with peach data overlaid and share your talent with friends coaches and scouts for the last year we've been working hard to make Scout to become a reality our award-winning design team designs coffee from scratch each player's needs in mind we created a small and robust device that is always with you whether you're at home or on the road which run the entire radar technology into this little box to achieve this we work closely with number of radio frequency and signal processing experts the result is a state-of-the-art Doppler radar solution that is as accurate and reliable as the best traders on the market scouting is a great training tool so accurate and so reliable you can use it for both trainings and games or just playing catch in the backyard people are the most creative and their children but the tools they used to create have not changed for years hi I'm roostin and this is the robo cube and it will change how our kids learn about technology introducing Robo wunderkind a revolutionary robotics kit for kids of all ages which can be programmed and controlled with smartphones and tablets Robo tubes can be attached from either side so you can make different robots two years ago I was signing computer science at the University of Technology and I was building robots on Arduino platform my friends were fascinated by what I was doing and they also wanted to build their own robots but it's no fun and simple way for them to get started this is why I decided to create a robot that would be easy to build that code and we'd be accessible for everyone we are embedding different electronics such as microcontrollers sensors motors and divin cameras into the cubes this way kids can easily build a unique robots with different functions in any shape they can imagine I think it's really important that kids is introduced technology at a very young age and I think Robo is really interesting platform for enabling is so it makes the robotic technology accessible the biggest engineering charge for our team was to create a connection system between the cubes we've created the technology that will be easy to grasp given for a five-year-old child and it works perfectly just type the cubes build a robot and connected to each other via bluetooth we've created an intuitive app that kids really love you don't have to write any code to program the robot just jack Andrew blocks in the app and press Start teachers love the way kids learn by playing with a robot that's why we've also developed a curriculum for teachers on how to use rubber when they can't in the classroom Robo introduces the younger students to authentic 21st century skill and it targets an age group that sometimes doesn't really have that opportunity children learn by playing and experimenting and I can't think of a better thing to support than Robo where students are having fun but they are learning with our amazing robotics kit we are teaching children three key skills robotics coding and creative thinking and there is one more thing we've made an adapter that will make robot wunderkind compatible with your Legos all of our backers on Kickstarter will receive these adapters so that you can bring your toys to hold you thank you for watching if you like this video please share it with
