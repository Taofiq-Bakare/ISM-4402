I'm really excited about the lens as a completely new way to do interfaces it looks out of the world experience I'm excited to just get a sense for how well it feels intuitively to interact with what's actually around me this is next-level the bridge between the technical and non-technical folks hololens can wish them all so excited about the idea being able to take data sets in the scientific world and be able to interact it away three dimensionally that they're just so few ways you can really do right now I have so many ideas for this thing I site either dying to get my hands I want to actually use it I'm sure it will be all over the place in five years Alexis approached with that questions for a new project we thought it will not work of what let's try it but we did it step by step we thought it would be really interesting and we thought maybe they need drag off 10 meters and just can all be done and would be quite easy when I then heard about these plans for jumping and other things like okay that's a tough job this track hit three polls in North Pole a South Pole and then a North Pole and in between there is a magnetic field which is on top of the track now how to seize this with your eyes you cannot see anything of course but you can sense it with the magnetic material as soon as you come closer you feel the force of the magnetic field 25 years ago the high-temperature superconductors were detected the superconductors inside of the broads are made of yttrium barium copper oxide and if you bring the superconducting material at a distance above this strike and put it down with liquid nitrogen gets its superconducting properties then this stores this magnetic field and is able to levitate above this strike segment as long as I discovered a very stable levitation is possible which is passive you do not need any energy for this one can freeze in a magnetic field in the superconductor that was a question could you imagine having inclines we also GES and tried to build one and then can be declines and gave the bended curves in a very small radius and so things developed real really amazing fascinating project we hope to inspire people this project may show them nothing is impossible what I find fascinating about textiles is a structure of textiles it's the same thin structure of touch screens which we using in every day mobile devices and tablets that means that if you just replace some of the threads in textile a conductive threads you should be able to weave the textile which can recognize a variety of simple touch gestures just like any normal that's bangle you have a mobile phone the idea that jock art is an interface I just blended into the clothing that we wear that has an implication in the way that you would use services products applications and anything that we do through our devices it's somehow getting the technology out of the way in making interactions more natural and more seamless in terms of what the technology can do it's really up to the user and to the designers and we expect that users can reconfigure it as much as they want to software development and fashion design chicken is a blank canvas designers and developers we are just at the beginning and we are really excited to see what people gonna do with it you drawing draw fix and create new things each extension is equipped with an automatic detector so you only need to insert and start to create with the soldiering nozzle you can fix or create any electrical component the tip can reach a maximum temperature of four hundred and ninety degrees are you a creative person who likes original items using the extension for burning you can decorate for example wooden spoons a belt wallet or your leather shoes at the same time you can shape 3d models and printouts if you're a model maker or handyman you'll be interested in our extension for cutting plastics and foam materials you can make a functional RC plane a ship a clock or an amusing sponge for children these for extensions are included in each package don't be limited by regular cable and start using our power pack you can power your 3d simo mini mobile phone

Android launches globally in summer 2015 you the hand is ultimate into device it's a silly precise it's extremely fast and it's very natural for us to use it right capturing the possibilities of human hand was one of my passions how do we take this incredible capability finest of human actions of finest of refusing our hand but applied to the virtual world we use radio freaks the spectrum which is radars to track human hand the Raiders has been used for many different things to track cars big objects satellites and planes we're using them to truck micro motions twitches of human hands then use it to interact with wearables and internal things and other computing devices our team is focused on taking radar hardware and turning it into a gesture sensor radar is a technology which transmits a radio wave towards a target and then the receiver of the radar intercepts the reflected energy from that target the reason why we're able to interpret so much from this one radar signal is because of the full gesture recognition pipeline that we've built the various stages of this pipeline are designed to extract specific gesture information from this one radar signal that we receive at a high frame rate now we are the point where we have the hardware we can sense these interactions and we can put them to work we can explore how well they work and how well they might work in products you
