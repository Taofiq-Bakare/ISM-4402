and welcome back to the emerging tech virtual summit I'm your host Chris Cashman thank you for being here emerging technologies keep the business world abuzz with the promise of new opportunities in one sector that's particularly energized today is the startup community as you can see in that video of course modern-day startups they're nimble they're savvy and well positioned to harness these opportunities and for more on that lets meet our panel we got a good one for you from the Microsoft New York City we have entrepreneur in residence to raise NM ishani here with us are from great horn the cloud security firm that's making headlines for its cutting-edge cyber security solution we have CEO Kevin O'Brien here and finally from little bits the breakthrough startup that's making electrical engineering accessible and fun for everyone including your kids we have retail account manager Kristen Smith thank you all for being here thank you thanks for having we are going to start with our poll question this is where we turn the tables on the audience we ask you a question you weigh in and we'll reveal those results here during the interview now imagine you are handed 250 thousand dollars to build something to disrupt your industry on purpose which emerging technology do you base it on where you going to spend your money a artificial intelligence be cloud see augmented reality D block chain or will it be Internet of Things it's your quarter million to spend let us know where you're going to spend it and we'll reveal those results and will react here coming up Turay so let's start with you you have an interesting job title how do i get entrepreneur-in-residence and what does that mean sure so as we're hearing today Microsoft invests a whole lot into emerging technology that we create ourselves right well it's no surprise that tremendous innovation and emerging technology also is developed outside of the walls and a Microsoft not a big shocker right well that technology is very important to us as well and much of it comes through startups and those startups tend to be born in ecosystems in start-up ecosystems so I am or captain if you will for the startup ecosystem in New York pretty pretty big one right now and a lot of the time that I spend is with major accelerate third party accelerators not ones that are actually run by Microsoft but they're very important to us because they really have their fingers on the pulse of what's coming up we get to meet those startups and really start placing some bets ourselves in terms of where we think interesting things are happening we want to make meaning between those startups and Microsoft because again a lot of really interesting innovation is happening there so confession I am a recovering entrepreneur myself that's the runge point that I'd come from right forgive me so am i you're in a safe place yeah and a lot of my job is not only talking to many many many and you know kind of picking some that look really interesting and who perhaps they have great track records or they're onto something and i'll advocate for them inside of Microsoft advocate to them to our customers and advocate for Microsoft back to them as well because so much has changed at Microsoft there are a lot of assets here that can really help them grow further and faster it's obviously familiar to entrepreneurs and small business model it often it's just a few people trying to do something great with very little so it makes sense that emerging technologies would be a big part of that what are you seeing that's that's really so true and I think when we pick some favorite emerging technologies right now such as artificial intelligence you know everything related to the cloud virtual reality IOT you know etc it's oftentimes startups that rush to the fore to create the earliest implementations in disruptive scenarios for specific verticals etc they're super rapid iteration and they learn a lot really fast so you really can have kind of David Goliath situation so we want to be around that yeah now during the introduction I mentioned that you're a part of the disruptive startup the world's Kevin we'll start with you tell us about great horn talk about the company in general and why should the people watching pay close attention to what you're doing sure so horn is a cyber security solution that's focused on the kinds of threats that we see come over we call cloud communications infrastructure and so we started this business with first observation ninety percent of all of the data breaches that you've seen in the news over the past couple of years think about the Office of Personnel Management at the federal government level or the loss of data records around our health insurance from something like an anthem those attacks start today not by somebody writing some custom piece of code that's going to be super target around your organization it happens but most of the time it's actually because somebody in person it's an individual inside of that company be it a CEO or CFO or some other senior executive and tricks an ordinary employee into doing something they should now this is not a brand new problem but when we looked at the market we saw that the ways that big companies were protecting themselves against this are very much old-school they were running devices that you had to go and provision put on a server rack somewhere spend weeks or even months getting them up and running and then dedicate resources to solving all of these security challenges that they would highlight we said there's got to be a better way we live in this era of cloud computing and technology and Big Data instant-on operationalization of these kinds of technologies like say office 365 you can stand up in minutes not weeks or months so we said we should have a security solution for that threat that works exactly the same way and that's what great horn is Wow all right so what kind of emerging tech did you implement yeah so one of the challenges that companies have when they start thinking about this problem space unless you're in a very select and narrow band of industry in all likelihood you cannot hire enough security professionals to sift through all of the data and find threats at the moment they come in so we invested heavily at the outset in artificial intelligence and machine learning to allow us to do that on behalf of our clients and today when we stand up something like a great horn environment for a customer of ours we're providing them protection immediately at the moment they stand up that instance which takes only five or ten minutes they're benefiting from all of that collective wisdom all of that cloud computing power and all of that artificial intelligence to defend what they can't hire someone to do manually right and you're still a relatively small company trying to solve a pretty big problem so for the big companies out there how do they implement what you started to discover yeah so let me take an example from one of those clients of ours that represents a fairly large company we work the West Coast technology firm that does customer experience surveys they're the fastest growing company in the space they've been using us for the last two months and they were receiving on average fifty of these impersonation attacks to their CFO pretending to come from the CEO a week and so that was yielding a tremendous amount of work for them and it was representing a major threat because if one of even just one of those 50 were to actually be executed they would wire out tens of millions of dollars catastrophic for a business they were able to send up great horn in under five minutes and they went on record last week and a major piece of press for us saying that they were now capturing through great horn ninety percent of those attacks with no manual labor no effort they don't look at it once a week to confirm that the system still working because it's doing such a good job and that's the story for any big company because we've made that investment on the technological side make the easiest and up great Kristin tell us a little bit about little bit so what problem are you trying to solve and why yeah so if you think about it we have sixty-five percent of grade school children will have jobs in the future that don't exist yet so what we're trying to do is equip the next generation with the tools that they need to be prepared for those jobs and careers of the future so little bits is a platform of easy to use electronic building blocks think legos for the next generation when you snap them together you make circuits and those circuits make inventions with our platform of easy to use electronic building blocks we're literally on a mission to get the world inventing Wow we love that so what innovation and emerging technologies is little bits leaning on yeah so in New York in our Manhattan office we have a team of engineers and those engineers are literally prototyping new bits all of the time we're always on the search with our R&D team to figure out what are the new bits and technologies that we need to bring into our platform for example we have the cloud bit which connects to the out of course or so you can now have cloud connectivity with your inventions but I think what's more important when you're talking about emerging technology and little bits is how little bits is actually educating our users about the emerging technologies around them think about it there's so many devices in our everyday lives that we encounter that most of us can't really explain how they work or really understand what's happening behind that glass screen and so with little bits you can actually recreate those emerging technologies think your IOT devices that are super help right now with little bits you can actually recreate nest but even further our founder believes that you should not just consume electronics but you should create with electronics with little bits you can actually create inventions to solve problems that are maybe only unique to you like the father whose daughters their chore was to feed the chickens and when he went on vacation he wanted to make sure they're doing their chores so he actually created an invention using little bits to make sure that his daughters were feeding the chickens Wow we love that all right well so let's talk about from the startup world at how it's different using emerging technologies versus you know being established organizations or maybe too scared right to try something new everybody can weigh in on this the difference in how startups are infusing life with emerging technology yeah I mean to me I think it's all about rapid iteration failing fast and you know shipping something very quickly and seeing if it works in and of itself and also how it interacts with the end user or the customer that's going to use it you just can't wait to put thing out you know they say no no battle plan survives contact you know with the enemy or with the market and and startups need to live in and die by this and they and they truly do and that the most disciplined you know smartest startups are you know iterating and shipping at a rate that you know traditional companies you know hadn't hadn't been they weren't really built around that mmhmm yeah for us at little bits our platform is modular and we're you're talking about how quick we start ahead and move and we really take that modular approach internally as well and so not only are the kits modular but internally when we have to solve a problem it's about figuring out which of that piece do we need to maybe move around reconfigure that allows us to move so quickly so I started working in technology 17 years ago yeah and if you look at how we built technology in the 90s in the early 2000s it was slow it was difficult to test having the ability to now execute so quickly and iterates so quickly gives us a tremendous market advantage and a lot of large companies in a space like ours are still stuck with those legacy products and those legacy processes so much like what Teresa and Kristen said having that technology at our disposal without all of the the anchor weight behind us of old-school servers and old-school processes for software development let us compete even in markets that are very big and very established so Teresa it sounds like you know your work obviously exposes you to a lot of small businesses how do you select a great horn little bits those like how do you select them in why so on one level you know I won't lie pounding the pavement constantly you know seeing thousands of startups so there is a volume aspect and I think you do start seeing some patterns but you know you need to be smart about it we have great partners in the marketplace you're constantly nurturing connections among other people who are hopefully smarter than you are that are seeing really interesting things so keeping constantly connected with that is a big piece of it another thing is that through you know serve programs and touch points that Microsoft does have with startups such as great horn and little bits that we've been working actually quite deeply with we really get to know them and so similarly to the testing we were talking about we start doing something together that's a little that's kind of easy you know a little small low risk and then when we learn from that like double down let's do something a little bit bigger together and then let's build on that and build on that so there's a well-respected venture capitalist named mark sister who likes to say he invests in lines not dots and I think that's a key message to think about with the startup ecosystems I mean I truly believe in great horn and little bits and that they're going to be successful but I also truly believe in Kevin and I believe in Kristin and the team at little bits and whether it's the startups that they're working on or the next things that they work on really great people keep coming back and keep coming back so we want to kind of keep our fingers on the pulse of really smart people who are always moving on to the next emerging technology well and so yeah speaking of that what what trends are we seeing in the startup world in respect to emerging technology itouch pretty much all of them yeah some favorites you know a ton happening in block chain right now it's been very exciting to watch Microsoft making big bets around blockchain as a service that creates kind of a rallying point where even more startups are attracted to do stuff with us virtual and augmented reality huge you know absolutely anything and everything you know cloud enabled we're seeing artificial intelligence being applied to so many different scenarios some you would expect and many you would never you know have thought of and then it kinds of builds on itself so a little bit like the modular Lego is we start combining different emerging technologies and and truly you know new futures emerge from that yeah you're talking about it unless futures so let's ask you the forecasting time crystal ball where do you see your companies in 2020 which is terrifyingly close it's hardly the future but where do you what do you see what do you what is your company's about what do you think is realistic so the trend that isn't going to slow down is the adoption of cloud computing and I think if you look in the fortune 500 the fortune 1000 these are organizations that are making big bets and foundational ways today that their businesses are going to run in a different fashion than they did even five years ago so we see great horn as being the security fabric for cloud communication infrastructure any time either individuals or systems communicate we think we have a role to play in authenticating that messaging and making sure it's not an attack or trying to steal sensitive data or get resources they shouldn't have access to what do you think little bits 70 20 20 20 so close still on earth right still on earth okay right around the corner you know when we think about little bits and we think about the future remember as every student is required to have a calculator to go to school or maybe every single parent doesn't hesitate to bring play-doh or Legos into the household we really believe that across nationwide worldwide schools and parents at home will the little bits will be the common product that they're bringing in it'll be the standard that they grow their children up with and that students and kids will start to be able to recognize all the electronic components on all the technology around them through playing with little bits so I'm going to throw a curveball in here if I may yeah since we have a little time together so I'm a mother of two daughters a 13 year old and a nine-year-old and they're big little bits fans so in 2020 right my 13 year old is going to approximately be graduating from high school maybe but hopefully right around then and you know I would love to be able to say as a parent that my daughters are conversant in how things work in electronics and stuff like that and are actually pretty fearless about saying well such-and-such doesn't exist let me try to make it right so so that's that's my vision for 22 yeah I complain they're here with you take that a step further we believe that the innovation is going to be coming out of the labs of Microsoft and MIT and into the homes and I don't think it's going to be far off where we're seeing very powerful ideas inventions new emerging technologies that are going to be coming from a home in the Midwest or a school down south I think it's snuff are all we've done some pop-up events together you know bringing kids to the table and you know what they come up with you just wouldn't have on your own remember the kit Odin with the anti-bullying machine yes awesome yeah you know put it in their hands and see what they create yeah so we really need to democratize open source innovation get younger and younger so that our kids are equipped to yes make I want to weigh in on that for now too so we're obviously in a slightly different market I don't have the the pleasure of working with kids very often in cyber security but around the time that that you know 2020 comes around the folks who are in late elementary school high school today go by entering the job market and as a serial entrepreneur as someone who hires a lot of technologists I think there's a real gap in the level of skill that we see and so when you start to be able to democratize some of that access to not just creativity and Inquisition but technological expertise you're building a workforce that folks like me higher and so I think we're very excited to see things like that start to happen because the more we can drive into public education early childhood a sense of curiosity about how the world works but how these new technologies work the more ready we are to compete on a global stage it makes a lot of sense yeah in a world of don't worry there's an app for that we should also make sure that we actually know how stuff works a little bit or I'll make it out for that yes I'll make the out for that exactly before we move on I want to circle back to our poll question we put it out to the audience we have thousands of people watching right now we like to take their temperature find out what they think on these questions that poll question ladies and gentlemen you remember it you know it well and you wait and imagine you were handed $250,000 to build something that disrupts your industry which one emerging technology do you base it on you spend it on artificial intelligence would it be cloud would it be augmented reality or would it be d blockchain or maybe it's Internet of Things what do you think survey says thirty-four percent says Internet of Things your reactions to where they would spend their quarter mil I think we're talking about the same thing we were talking about just a second ago which is that technology when you think about the Internet of Things is about driving that technology into the the products we use on a day-to-day basis so I'm unsurprised by this result yeah same doesn't surprise me any good results yeah I think we're all you know inhabiting a world now especially mobile kind of put us into this mindset where you always have a computer in your pocket yeah and now I think we're like okay there everything that surround us has computing potential and data potential and can provide you know goodness to us that we never would have imagined before I of T is super exciting and every aspect absolutely well we know we've covered a lot today but we do have thousands of people watching from across the country specifically from your businesses the folks watching they're going to leave here and talk about this emerging tech summit they watch it was really cool I heard about this great horn what would you want them to say about your company if they're going to walk away and remember you for what yeah if you are in a public or private Lee trading company I guarantee you your boardroom is looking at your cyber risk and it's saying how are we going to not be in the wall street journal or the new york times or the front page of the BBC for the wrong thing and we are a very easy way to protect against the single most pervasive cyber attack and threat vector in the world we're doing it for hundreds of thousands of different mailboxes and clients today and it's something that anyone who's watching could bring to their cio or their chief security officer and be up and running in just 15 minutes so I've want them to walk away with that that idea that this is important but it doesn't have to be complicated Kristen little bits what do you want to bed yeah I'd say to remember that it is not hard to get your kids involved in electronics encoding you don't have to have knowledge in it prior to bring this into the home and have your kids just have a blast learning with little bits I would say run don't walk to Microsoft stores com where you can purchase a little bits if you have kids you will not regret bringing this into the home and just watching your kids go to town building things like a bit bought a remote control car or even pranks all with electronics of course while they're learning stem along the way yeah we love it all right well I'm from your point to Raisa what do you think what would you like folks to leave this session what impression would you like to make you know I'd like to leave leave the message try fast fail fast iterate so if there's an emerging technology you're curious about think about a cheap and easy way that you can test it out that might be you know calling up a start-up that's already a little further along than you are and saying hey can we do something together let me let's try something and um you know keep it narrow keep it light but try if you don't try you won't learn loving great stuff thank you guys so much yeah we would love to give everybody a tangible opportunity to follow up where would you like them to go to get more info specifically they say yeah I do love that I do my kids do need to have that where would you send them a little bit cc okay anyone who's interested in trying out great horn inside the organization can go to great horn calm and click the try button on the top right okay and otherwise JC on Twitter yeah that's bang it whatever you need to know just being it it's all out there for you thank you all so much for your time we appreciate it thank very education alright hey we've been talking a lot about new opportunities technology is creating and some of today's most tremendous opportunities are emerging out of the Internet of Things which you all proved that you know about we have a video about that for you to see right now and then when we come back to experts are here to show you how to harness the power of IOT and predictive analytics right after this
