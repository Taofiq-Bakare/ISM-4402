hi this is lucas Carlson from Centrelink I'm the chief innovation officer and today I'd like to go through the top five tech trends that I see in emerging tech so the first one that I'd like to talk to you about is darker you might have heard about docker docker is the fastest-growing open-source technology in history actually it's grown faster than anything else out there and it keeps getting mentioned over and over so what is dr. docker is a very simple technology it's a very simple tool for managing Linux containers and Linux containers can be thought of like its subsections of virtual machines so if a virtual machine gives you kind of the cloud servers that you get today Linux containers can subdivide it even further and make it even smaller now what's the difference between a virtual machine and a docker container the idea is that with a docker container all of the doctor containers on a sale on the same host will share the same Linux kernel so there's a little less separation between the containers than there are virtual machines every virtual machine gets its own kernel so there's a that's pretty much the big difference now there's some security issues around that but if you're dealing with a single host single user system that the security stuff is not something to worry about so docker would be the first trend that I'd be urging you guys to think about today the second trend that I would recommend looking into is orchestration orchestration is a technology for managing large groups of computer resources in a centralized way so instead of spinning up individual works machines and try to allocate applications to them with orchestration the orchestration layer is kind of a smart layer of technology that decides where to put your workloads so you're no longer deciding where to put your workloads but the orchestration technology is doing that for you some of the technology out there rightscale did this for virtual machines Bezos and the mesosphere company are doing this for docker and Linux containers and make those projects something that's been used to help scale Twitter and lots of well-known websites it's a very modern way of doing things it's been proven at scale so thinking about ways to automate the deployment of workloads and not using individual compete resources one off at a time is a very big trend that I see growing in the next year going along with this automation trend orchestration being the second the third trend that I would recommend looking into is continuous integration can continuous deployment the idea behind continuous integration is that testing should be something that is done manually but rather be an automated process that every time you check in any code anything that changes with your application should automatically go through an entire system a barrage of tests continuous integration and continuous deployment things like Jenkins allow you to automate this whole process so that instead of having people doing a lot of QA you can have more computers automatically doing your testing and continuous deployment takes it from the tested code into the orchestration to automate the deployments of the code so you want to think more and more about integrating automation wherever you can the fourth trend is micro everything integrating automation is a lot easier when the things that you're integrating are in smaller chunks smaller units and so there's this trend that's going on in the industry that's going to continue of things getting smaller and smaller and smaller the units are becoming smaller code is becoming smaller one of the examples of this is the go programming language which is a lap allows you to compile down to a single binary on any platform and this gold programming language is kind of the next generation something like C or C++ that allows you to have kind of the same benefits but the code is a lot smaller it's a lot easier to use its lot more robust and you see this micro everything another micro trend is micro frameworks so instead of loading all of your application code into one monolithically large application you decompose it into smaller frameworks that talk to each other through api's so using frameworks like rubies it has Sinatra and there's all sorts of micro frameworks in every programming language you can then make smaller applications that are easier to automate the final trend is mobile mobile has been a trend for a while but there's no stopping it it keeps growing people keep buying more smartphones and that trend is continuing at exponential growth we're nowhere near full saturation so there's so much growth to happen and the mobile industry is going to keep becoming more and more important over the coming years so watch out for mobile look into micro and focus on automation that's the kind of tech trends you should be looking into right now
