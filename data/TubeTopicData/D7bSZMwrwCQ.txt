well basically this is a very elastic symposium covering all important fields on precision medicine and how we can move forward so for example on the first session that we had this morning actually was centered on the patient and the patient advocates because at the end what all what we do is Center it on the patient so we want to promote as much as possible really personalized medicine moving forward and implemented in the patient so that's why this session was very important the next one it's covering some important aspects on how new diagnostic tools may improve the way on on what we have a complete evaluation of not only of the tumor of the patients but also in some instance and the cost because everything it's important and this is not only related to genomics is also related to transcriptomics proteomics new technologies that are evaluating more and more these components of the tumor and also all the bio informatics process that leads at the end to some meaningful information that can be translated into therapeutic so this is really very important also fundamentally from a meeting like this is interaction that we have with pharma companies and there are going to be some seminal presentations on how we can especially combined new legs because we know that the tumors are heterogeneous so we have different clones and drugs have to be combined so this is a very important question so how we are going to be combining these racks targeted asians kinase inhibitors and even within monotherapy approaches because we have the revolution of immunotherapy but it's still difficult to think about how we combine these drugs either altogether or on the right sequence but obviously discussions on this are really very important also interestingly we are going to focus on sun tumors where we have been succeeding on on how we can categorize and I'm reclassify these tumors in in different subtypes based on all these technologies genomics proteomics that I have mentioned before so basically we have the example in colorectal cancer breast cancer and lung cancer so examples of what can be done in this highly frequent tumors but also in other tumors that are more rare interestingly we also have a whole session on how the dynamics of this is I can be evaluated because we are putting a lot of pressure in the tumors with new drugs new targeted agents even within monotherapy but the situation is that the tumor balls over time not only spontaneously but also due to the pressure that some of these drugs exhibit to the tumor and and this is really very important a very fascinating topic but actually helps us clinicians to develop tools that can be easy easy access for example the liquid biopsy but only looking to circulating tumor DNA now we are transitioned to other very interesting feels like mrna and exosomes in the blood and this is still very experimental but sure we are completely sure that the district nurses will add important information also on tailoring on how to tailor the treatment over time and finally we are going to end with another important session on how we can translate this amount of data the big data that we have into what it's called Smart is Mar date right at the NS market it's what we can translate to meaningful opportunities for patients and there is going to be even a debate on the pros and the cons of this translation of big data to a smart data well out of this I think introversion is going to be on the new technologies just to evaluate the dynamics of diseases mentioned the important field for all kind of liquid biopsies is when everyone and the second one also important for the patients or even more important is how we use this information to tile or combinations of treatments including targeted agents and immunotherapy and and certainly some of the new clinical trials that are being generated by the wing consortium actually are taking all these approaches and translating this to the ultimate goal that we want and that is the benefit for our patiently we all do this for patients so that's why they are in the center of our consortium even we have members that are patients abrogates in the consortium but also as you have seen in the wind symposium actually have the first and the plenary session centered on the under patients and the patients have brigades I think it's a very unique conference because in two days too busy days I have to say you have a very holistic approach on the field of personalized medicine and that's the beauty of the of the wing consortium so the members that we have represent not only academic institutions represent also pharma companies diagnostic companies pitch in a brigades even regulators are coming to the consortium and the meeting and actually with this interaction because we have a lot of interaction we can promote very rapidly the the field of precision medicine moving forward to the patients
