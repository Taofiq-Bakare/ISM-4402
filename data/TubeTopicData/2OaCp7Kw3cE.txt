thank you Matt thanks everybody for coming today and thank you to the organizers of UX New Zealand I'm for having me here i'm actually really excited to be here and thank you for my new cardigan very nice and sean i'm really happy that you made this presentation before me because nice press in your minds and this can be like a continuation just keep some of the things that he has been talking about because some of the things that i'm going to talk about it they keep some close relation then this was actually going to be a joint presentation unfortunately my colleague karina Coutinho me join me on the stage today so I'm afraid that you will have to be a stack here with me and dealing with my accent for 30 minutes bear with me it's actually exotic so for for what I heard before I think a lot of us we share the same problem I struggle a lot trying to explain what I do when people ask me what do you do for a living I really wish they would be the CC where it's not that usually probably we are dealing with the same the same issue right somebody asked you what do you do and then you start saying well you know we try to make analyze services and products we try to make the process smoother and delightful for for users and then you you quote a couple of examples like you know uber torsade UX designer behind you know Airbnb there's a you execute designer behind this thing is pretty much under control what I have a problem with is a follow up question and usually yourself yeah cool I think I get it so which type of product are you working on and then I said in augmented reality say what oh yeah well more precisely we use image recognition deep learning and context on information to display relevant content in augmented reality I keep on falling in the same mistake of the password I've put myself in the same trap but I must admit that it makes for a really good small talk at family reunions and it it made me think a lot on what it means being a designer in this space in emerging tech so here's the topic of the talk the design for American technologies on a SI how do we design for emergent technologies because I want to share my story with you I want to tell you about my experience i'm working on the air space and the challenges that we faced and how we solved it and the things that we didn't solve yet so let's start with the more emerging technologies emerging technologies are those that are perceived to have the capability of changing the status Q they're generally new but they might be some old technologies as well that are still emerging because they are in develop or they're somehow controversial often technologies they require a trigger a trigger event either in industry social in technology socio-economics to reach mainstream adoption so you see for example that virtual reality is pretty much ahead of augmented reality right nowadays mostly because of its feasibility because we have electric cars before is look at this baby 1912 and he could run 40 miles with a charge the electric car was birthed for years in fact there's a documentary that's called who killed the electric car and then in the latest recession with a we have started to analyze our dependency from fuel and from oil and they blow it back to the picture hybrid cars came and Tesla made them an object of desire we had a smart phones too I used to work for nokia and we used to call these portable computers they still have one of those multi-touch was what made this Martha the smartphones less threatening this thing was quite intimidating and the App Store made them useful before they were apps but they were this java apps that you were site loading most most of the times he wasn't worth the effort who had br2 before before Google cardboard before oculus this was sick fer it wasn't released because it was too expensive to Spencer the device and too expensive to produce games so yeah the time for BRS is now because this thing is ten dollars so besides feeling terribly all right now by showing you all these devices I designed for you I want to tell you that I designer your products and Asia has been around for about 60 years 62 65 years when I tell people that I design a our products this is what I would like to think that they envision my job but in reality is something more like this I know it's a bummer it's not so different to what everybody in our discipline does but it comes with its own set of challenges let me tell you a little bit about the company that I work for it's called bleep er its startup and it actually started the business associating itself in marketing and advertisement with big brands it was riding the wave of the wow effect of AR and it they did quite well the mechanism was was pretty simple you have an appt let's call bleep bar and then somebody has uploaded an image into the ER visual search server that image is called a flippable image and then if somebody scans the image with the bleep are up we call that flipping applicable image and then they will they will see another layer and augmented reality experience on top of that that can be a 3d animation it can be a video it can be a mini game and we call that a blip so if you flip a blippo image you get a blip one thing here if if Conan terms is as part of your business strategy you are making life really difficult to listeners nowadays we have expanded the visual recognition of the app and now recognizes thousands of daily life obvious that means that we don't rely anymore only in user generated content the app can recognize an object and you can gather some information you can show you the information about that object and you can also show you how is it connected to other objects in such a way that you could flip redbull can it will tell you that the recipe the original one was coming from Thailand and then from Thailand you can go to Southeast Asia and in from Southeast Asia to know you can go to the colonialism the European colonialism this is where we are right now there is not how we started and it's probably not where we are going to end up working in tag is usually pretty dynamic working in a murine tag is is crazily fast things change a lot and it's full of unknowns when you move in an ambiguous new domain there's limited research you can rely on there's not much market market research that you can that you can get data from mostly because the market is still yet to be open there's limited competitive analysis probably because you're the first the first one in the in this space or your competitors are struggling with the same thing as you do so probably are even looking at you so my first steps into a comment the reality we're actually exploring the space I experimenting with what was possible with with the technology how was it perceived the unique characteristics of interaction in mixed reality and they use media art as my playground exploring augmented reality and natural user interfaces in interactive installations so this installation was called a deja vu and it explored idea of multi presence so it was simulating CCTV camera recordings so the viewer could feel like it was at the same time in different room simultaneously desire one I call it a yourself II had a more utilitarian approach it was developed with Razorfish in in Sydney it was a prototype to explore the idea of magic mirrors Mayan you're living in a super connected house and then somebody can send you an image and the image is being pulled on your world and you can include yourself in the image strike a pose and send it back with these experiments of what I learned is first that this sort of magic mirror this call it projected augmented reality it's interesting but it's not as powerful as a first-person experience and the second one is is this this is trying to emulate a UI on the 3d space when you're working with gestures on a 3d space is physically straining when you're talking about the yarder of times it comes to your mind is minority report image with the Tom Cruise movie everything around tell you what if he would be working seven hours a day doing that thing he would have the shoulders of a bodybuilder to get started to getting inspired with a new technology science fiction is actually a good resource and and you can tell from my slides that I love size fig science fiction and a classic works like a Asamoah for pop culture TV shows or films like Star Trek logan's run back to the future they can give you an idea of humanity streams and you can help you see if some of the of those dreams have been fulfilled already good current tech so if you just look at the star trek for example tablet computers check video calling check and with victoire reality actually we are going to have some sort of teleportation so let's do a semi check their science fiction inspiration can be quite powerful layer that was one of the pioneers in the consumer augmented reality was funded based on to fiction works one was a one anime that was called Daniel Koidu and the other one was a novel called rainbows end let's not be afraid to use our imagination and to put on the table the most ridiculous of ideas because they can give some surprise surprise and results let me tell you story about the foundation of Blippar that the company that I that I work for our CEO or rich he likes to tell to tell a story about how him and his mates they were spending some time in a tub they were having some points in England and then the last run they will amounted something like 15 pounds and they paid with a 20 pound spill the waiter was taking some time to bring the change back so one of them made a joke say like could you imagine if the Queen of England could step Stan start out of there 20 pounds feel and say hey I won my 5 pounds back and Omar there was a at this time his coworker and i was a co founder and the CEO of the company has a strange sense of humor and the day after he came back with the first prototype of her Oh bleep are at that point he said like I can do it and he did it what I'm getting to hear is exploring the space have to be open and you have to be observant too past present and even fictional behaviors you don't have to limit yourself to current tech because probably tech is going to be faster move faster than you when you are thinking about solutions think about about what is going to be available in the future so as an example right now or before we were working with image recognition and now we are doing visual browsing and the next step made it could be face recognition and after that maybe the technology is going to enable us to be able to recognize the environment and even after that once you know that I'm in this room I will be able to display some augmented reality content on top of it mapping it and even after that that content could be dynamically generated and being Taylor depending on your situation your context so we have been playing we have an exploring we have used our fantasy or imagination but now it comes there comes reality reality strikes and this may your question we ask what is this for it can be very tempting to let it be technology driven develop something that is technically sophisticated really see and see what happens often we find ourselves reverse engineering at use case for the technology we work with this becomes even more complex when you are putting trying to create a business case into the equation especially if you work for a start up the pressure to start generating revenue you can make you can push you to make up a fictional use case just to justify the use of your tech to investors this is not only delusional and it doesn't work at the lawn on the long run is actually pretty dangerous let me steal this slice from micron montero stock is one of my favorite talk so how designers destroy the world if you didn't watch it do it his style he makes you feel like shit at the beginning of the other videos representation and then it pulls you up and makes you feel courageous about what you're doing this quote has been resonating in my head a lot of what I do I'm the one to get through dramatic here but we are creating a future and we as designers we have the responsibility of using our skills to create something that solves a real problem the brings real value and the benefits people with unknown user goals every single step that we make is an assumption we have to make sure that we are testing and we are validating every single scenario that we come up with so what is good for a hour you might wonder to start well if it's a problem that you cannot solve with a keyboard or with a mouse maybe it's a good a starting point so you can give it a try some years ago we run an experiment about a user-generated content in in augmented reality what could be interesting for people so we grabbed a bunch of people into our office we gave them each one of them attack of stickies and we told them leave the office now work around for an hour and a star posting sticky notes on the things that you find interesting and then write and comment on that and we work after them they were taking us of the steps that were showing us the comments and we saw that people were were using as a self expression it was sort of a offer really low the fidelity graffiti some people were placed in post-its on top of the postage that somebody play's before based on these this experience gave birth to an appt goalie stick to call a stick to and it was sort of a knock you into reality graffiti app and he had a really strong social component the app was life for a couple of years and we gather a lot of information about it especially in regards of a user-generated content and how people interact with others on the virtual space with unknowns we're also entender of creating fictitious user groups if I search now in google images for augmented reality that is stock photo comes in early adapters are not always teenagers or young professionals there are uber social and hyper connected more often there someone who are already good at what they do but they they're struggling with the tools that they if they have available I really like this use case because this augmented reality is not flashing it's not futuristic but it solves a problem it solves any specific problem at the specific point of time so everything is an assumption when working with somebody with something new everybody gets really excited imagination flies everybody comes up with a really crazy ideas when you are a variation stage you have to canalize those synergies and make everybody check with ground control and make sure that we are developing a solution that satisfies a real problem either present or future my colleague karina designed this framework to envision possible future scenarios and celina stakeholders you know during the brainstorming sessions so it has a full presentation on this topic so I'm not going to get a very deep and just talk for it thing really is pretty much to the to what field was talking this this morning so probably you are running some works off with that so this this framework three calls it forwards and a northeast are so what you do you create a list of possible driving forces based on current trends of facts and you rank them and from them you created any scenario grid the driving forces have to be miserable so in this case you have a concern is economy another concern is privacy so you go and your grid goes from economic depression to an economic prosperity and two not share absolutely anything be concerned about your privacy or you don't care about your privacy you share everything then you create for possible worlds based on these quadrants you define then you describe and you tell a story about it about it's one of these these worlds and for each world you come up with a currency the currency is a prime value for the people in this world to find this this value we can ask questions like what would you see in this in this future scenario gold would you see in there in the news headlines or what kind of business with thrive in this in this world with these values we build a prototype for to satisfy each one of these worlds and we will have that in mind when we are looking towards our North Star that is our our goal for the final product so we will be coming back and forth as our path our road map changes and we see that we are leaning towards one world or another we will be referring to these prototypes first I said before emerging tech it has the potential to change the status Q our mission is utilitarian they are making an AR new media channel for a screen Ellis future in order to do so we have to provide country and this content has to be useful in our team in San Francisco we are working into bringing a our creation to the masses so we just will release a Content addition tool is that the beta is still our first iteration and the main character Cal State stick is being powerful in ass with a really low learning learning curve so sort of our prototype in design mix with a 3d animation and target to powerpoint users so the idea is that anyone could be able to create decent quality content so then anyone could use the app and find that content in augmented reality but this comes with a risk user user generated content can become noise we have to find ways to filter this high quality content erm and if you remember the days of of personal websites in the 90s with all this animated gifs and dancing babies and dancing hamster or even the first days of YouTube opening a new channel to public needs to evolve and we have to offer mechanisms to help that son of reach maturity this also brings us to challenge augmented reality sell itself what does it mean the virtual content that we want to display an augmented reality is is there something more than animations of 3d or mini games what about audio or what about smells or haptic feedback that's also mental reality this app web wave finder was one of the winners of interaction awards this year and it's a tourist guide of London for blind people is all audio and it's guide by x becomes this is augmented reality if there is something that i would like you two to keep to take away home of all nights it's at today is that deck sodium means to an end and not the end text will be serving a goal and even though when we are working in a Marian technology the river seems to be true as designers in this domain we must use different methods to focus on finding a strong use case our goal is creating something useful that will influence people's behavior and create the habit of use only in this way is where we can move augmented reality further in the hype curve that I was showing you at the beginning so we are ready to build a future the greatest potential impact that we have is the new things that we are doing a living with our new creation as designers we have to be responsible of the impact of our creations a lot of them we we cannot anticipate in there will be a lot of a lot of site uses that might appear and that's great that's that's actually the beauty of it but we have to be aware of that and a word that we are introducing a change that we might be changes we have seen what the dystopian future looks like we have water park elliptic movies and is horrifying what might expect to us in terrible horrifying let's face it along our path will find some dilemmas that might even make us stopped of the purpose of our mission I have some some colleagues that they decided not to go on into this because they didn't believe that it was a future that wanted to leave then you are designing for the future and there could be a utopian paradise or it could be a dystopian Big Brother apocalyptic world I believe that a I'm a fortunate position to be working on this because I I can try to fight to use my values to to create a future that I that I believe is a future that is worth living for but you have to be aware of concerns you have to be aware of the dangers of it one of the biggest concerns is privacy how much privacy are we giving away we already given away a lot of privacy how much of our reality is going to be hijacked by corporations use injecting their marketing messages directly into our brains one point to think about that is that privacy is always in a state of flux the definition changes over time to enjoy the benefits of our new society we we have to give up some privacy's sort of a necessary evil but instead of fighting it we can flow with it believe me one day somebody is going to use their device maybe at that time is not going to be mobile devices pointed at your face and then see information around your face sounds scary but is very likely that you yourself put that information available online for people to check it we already do it we already share a lot of our lives online so this is a natural next step maybe this is going to bring more transparency everybody's exposed so maybe we are not so not native to scandals maybe privacy will not matter anymore so our notion of privacy is is the old model and it's changing I see for example that my notion of privacy I'm Spanish my wife is German and we have completely different ideas of what it came what it means keeping a window window open or taking your shirt off and I my goddaughters his 15-6 sharing online much more stuff that I was that I would be wishing she could be doing a year has the potential to be a game-changer to be an enabler to to free us from a world of staring at screens you can change social interactions you can change our urban landscape it can change politics fashion and our proper perception our perception of reality and he's doing it already if you notice and I'm like 20-25 minutes over a presentation about augmented reality and I didn't mention Pokemon go that's an achievement but here it comes this this is happening and this really shocking i was living in Japan for for about six years and the Hickock amore issue is a really big issue for those doors of you that don't know about that problem hikikomori are young adults that don't don't leave the room and sometimes they even stay in the room with the windows closed they don't want to interact with any human being at all they live with their families didn't go out for lunch there are families they leave the food at the door and whenever they hear they are going away open the door and take the things in there having a lot of government programs to try to help these people and I'm through psychotherapy hasn't been successful and I comes this game and these people are hitting the street they're going out and they're walking the streets and they are playing with each other and they are talking to people is amazing so what years of psychotherapy wasn't able to achieve one game could do it and the most amazing thing is that it wasn't it wasn't even intended it was a side effect vr na yaar successfully been used in in the whole world as well for to treat brain therapies for autism alzheimer and to recover for frontal medic experiences it's also used to or can be used to assist medical to use medical assistance for remote areas it can be used also to explain children about their about their diseases i love this one scholl Gamow and it's a toy that the medical staff can use to explain illnesses to children and to explain them how the treatment is affecting their body this is started to preschool aged children it's beautiful the thank you shown so I don't have to talk about this one we have seen what expeditions can do so if you translate this into the field of education with augmented reality you could bring it to the new world to their to the real world and you could be working this straight you could be working your normal commute route and loading content so well today I want to learn about the architecture so you load the content of active architectural work in the students okay this building is this type it is building of this type interesting so more I want to learn about trees so working out this is this type of tree is this type of trip so every day can be a new learning experience it can be also used to assist on on technical support for the super training for professionals as well or even years the man you have an elemental reality manual so the next time that your car is breaking down you pull out your tablet and you can see how you have to change the wheel of your car this was in the in London in the in the fashion show week i was fantasizing with a friend of mine just in mind in the future in which you're not wearing closes and you're not naked like these guys because it is cold but you're wearing a jumpsuit playing grape jumpsuit but you decide virtually what you're going to be wearing and that you are working the street people are going to see what you decided and you can change it on the fly on the fly you could maybe change it as with that I emeriti will be changing the world wallpaper of your computer or you could even decide which type of outfit outfit you want to show to which demographic why not and I wonder how would this affect what could be the impact on fashion and self-expression how how the fashion business would work without having to deal with different materials so summarizing the talk was about about the Marion technologies but I think the area all of this applies to to everything that we do as as UX prime practitioners we have to get inspired experiment act with responsibility because we are building the future and fast depends that the future that we are building is a future that is worth living in Machado started a poem with this sentence traveler there's no path the path is made by walking and now glad that this is a really exciting path to be walking in thank you
