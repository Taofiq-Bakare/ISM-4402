impact of emerging technologies emerging technologies refer to technical innovations which represent progressive developments within your field for competitive advantages first artificial intelligence or AI artificial intelligence deal with developing machines and software with human-like intelligence such as X persistence were computers have been programmed to make decisions based on information they are giving as in medical expert systems where patient's illness can be diagnosed based on symptoms input robotics refer to technology that deal with automated machines that can be programmed to take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes all resemble humans in appearance and behavior languages computers are programmed to give interpretation of different human languages as they are spoken to them game playing computers are developed to play games against human players impacts that artificial intelligence can have on everyday life increase leisure time robotic vacuum can clean floors without human intervention people can leave them running white as they enjoy extra leisure time a cure prediction of whether artificial intelligence is used to examine whether data more accurately than humans so that it can predict bad weather and automatically issues warning of approaching storms increase personal safety artificial intelligence software is used in modern home alarm systems to detect intruders then automatically errors the police improve medical care robotic surgery assistants are being used in surgical operations to quickly and accurately pass the correct tools to doctors the few seconds saved in the process may save patients life safer transport drive lease trains already exist in some countries as well as self-driving cars and cars capable of self parking already exist they could drastically reduce road accidents because machines avoid human errors labs using concentrations and defects in sight among other shortcomings vision enhancement low vision enhancement system uses video technology through headset connected to a computer images are projected inside the headset in front of the eyes objects appear closer for the user of the system night vision enhancement amplifies infrared light and visible light in order to see images in darkness in this process large source is captured and passed through an image intensifier tube to produce a clearer image used by the military to carry out surveillance at night biometrics refers to authentication techniques that rely on measurable physical characteristics of an individual that can be automatically checked there are several types of biometric identification schemes first fingerprint is the analysis of an individual's unique fingerprints second our recognition we have retina is the analysis of the capillary vessels located at the back of the eye and we have iris if the analysis of the colored ring that surrounds the eyes pupil third voice recognition is the analysis of the tone pitch Gideon's and frequency of a person's voice biometrics details such as fingerprints or voice matches are captured and stored within computer system so that they can be used to identify the person later on biometrics are used in place of passwords and physical locks as a means of secure the computer would analyze your fingerprint to determine who you are n based on your identity authorized you different levels of access access levels could include the ability to use credit card information to make electronic purchase biometrics have advantages over other methods of securities such as passwords and kids that could be lost forgotten or stolen impacts of biometric on everyday life better airport security iris recognition is already in use in some airports travels have their eyes scan into a system and this DK is later mashed up when the person is performing airport checks increase building security fingerprint access to buildings have been replacing the older methods of locks and keys these methods ensure that only authorized people can enter restricted buildings or rooms secure mobile phones some mobile phones use a fingerprint reader to identify the true owner of the phone and to protect the valuable data that it contains it will not unlock for a fingerprint that doesn't match reduce car theft course use fingerprints to unlock their doors or start the engine for the fingerprint that is reserved only this makes the car harder to see
